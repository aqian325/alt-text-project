        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>
          In her book, <u>More Than Meets the Eye</u>, Georgina Kleege asserts that description 
          is fundamentally interpretive and that objectivity is not even desirable. In this 
          seminar for <i>Media Art, Culture, and Social Justice</i>, students were assigned a single image from two collections in Northeastern University’s archives—the Asian American Resource Workshop and the Chinese Progressive Association. We researched the image from within the archive to contextualize its history, and learned about the distinction between image captions, alt text, and image description. Through this process, we connected with the histories of people who have meaningfully shaped the city of Boston, representing their stories with accuracy and care while exploring our own voices in the more subjective work of writing descriptions. We asked ourselves a question Kleege poses in her writing, ‘is an image worth a thousand words? And what do we do with those thousand words?’
