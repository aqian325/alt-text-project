Sidney Allen,M162_B011_F049_PNS_GarmetWorkers_1985-1988_002.jpg,"A black and white portrait of a young girl in a formal looking business blazer looks into the camera, she is on the outskirts of a large gathering of people. She is holding a nearly comically large sign relative to her size with a protest graphic depicted on it; the graphic of a clearly satirized, larger man beating another man in front of a scared group of people.","A small, nicely dressed girl is amongst the chaos of a protest. She is rather small compared to those around her, a tall, formally dressed man on her right and a woman dressed in a light color to her left. In the back of the photo are several people also attending the protest and some large buildings behind them. The picture is in completely black and white emphasizing the shadow and highlights in the image. She is staring right into the camera with a slightly surprised and fearful face as she holds up a large sign, one nearly as big as her. It has a small, hand drawn political cartoon pictured on it. It depicts a large cop attacking a bleeding man in front of three terrified witnesses.",This picture was taken in Boston’s Government Center in 1989 during a protest against Asian American hate and police brutality. This specific protest was centered around the Long Guang Huang case in which an Asian American man was wrongfully attacked by an out of uniform police officer.,"This photo is from the Northeastern archives in the ‘Chinatown Historical Photo Collection’. The photo was taken in Boston’s Government Center in 1985. Honestly, this project was definitely something I’ve never done before. It was a pleasant change of pace from the rest of the class as we’ve mostly been doing concept maps. It was a slow start for me, since I took an ill timed wellness day, but as soon as I got the hang of it, I hit the ground running. As I was doing my research, I found out some history that was completely new to me about the boston area. I never knew that the Long Guang Huang case happened, let alone in a city that is practically in my backyard. Even when researching the case that pertained to my image, I learned about not just the case, but also Chinatown and the history it holds and struggles it’s faced. I found it funny that after so many years of learning about American history and places like Boston, there is still so much more to learn. When working on my image, I used a lot of my time just studying the image itself. I found that before I could decipher the image, I needed to know its ins and outs. The more I stared the more I noticed a lot of subtle nuances, like showing a scared child to invoke a feeling of pathos and sympathy in the viewer of the image. This tactic is also used in a lot of other forms of media as children are an easy way to make viewers experience strong emotions. For example, the news often will display children in need to make viewers more likely to take action. Another nuance was in the graphic itself. I found an image in the archives, Image AO28576, that had the same graphic in the image except in color. The image in color is even more powerful as it has a lot of deep reds to represent the anger of the cop and the blood. It also showed the police in normal clothing rather than in a police uniform, which holds true to the case. This picture was taken at a protest, like I explained earlier, in which they were fighting against a specific police brutality case that stemmed from Asian American hate. A man by the name of Long Guang Huang was brutally attacked on May 1st, 1985 by a police detective who was out of uniform because the detective had suspicions he was a married man trying to hire a prostitute. An initiative quickly caught on entitled ‘Justice for Huang’, hence the protest, but despite this, it wasn't until 1989 that Huang received a settlement of $85,000 from the city of Boston. The political cartoon on the sign the girl is holding is a common symbol of protest surrounding the Long Guang Huang case. I found as I was writing the image caption, alt text, and image description, that I was using a lot of the same methods with different techniques and nuances. For the alt text, I used a more poetic voice for my writing and for my image description and caption I mostly used the visual and historical information I gathered to help form my paragraph or sentences. I believe this case and this picture relate heavily to class. It addresses topics we have directly gone over in class, like racism, corruption, police brutality, and speaking out. The people in this photo all wanted to speak out and show their stance in supporting Huang in his battles with the case, so they held a protest, created signs, and spoke out against the injustice they saw, and it made a difference; exactly what we are learning in class. I think this project is a good wrap up to end the course. It makes us apply our knowledge we’ve learned throughout the course to real world examples and allows us to really visualize how deep these issues can run.s/d/1A_vkKBbfSZxuENF8z-jpIM-bmehsWxPKMUXbFXVRGE8/edit?gid=0#gid=0","Photographs, 1908-2008, bulk: 1979-2008.

Victor Banworth,M210_B051_F052_EducationInChina_nd_001.jpg,"Mothers holding their children, smiling and laughing while the toddlers look around,
white walls with brown wooden benches on which the mothers sit on, mundane clothing
with simple patterns, a single polka dot shirt worn by a mother, the baby’s faces look
small and even blurred out, as with the rest of the image where it looks like the colors of
each object meshes together into some orange white tone. The camera shot gives
depth to the room and darkness in the two corners.","The image portrayed is at a nursery in China. More specifically, one at a textile mill in
Shanghai. The mother and their children wait to be tended to by a nurse. What is
interesting is the amount of women being at a textile mill with their children in 1972
China. The education system in communist China connects a direct link between
education and labor. Teachers and students alike would work in factories and in fields to
put into practice what they learned. So the factory was integral to Chinese education, as
well as social and economic life itself. It is not surprising that they would have a nursery
at a mill. Although I refer to women in the photo as mothers, they very much can also be
educators, going along with the communist integration of education and labor. The
mundane clothes do not give any indication of which they could be. The mysterious
figure at the end of the photo could be an officer or guard. The strollers are wooden and
almost look like they were built to be props. A nurse walks out into the room carrying a
baby, smiling. A half cut off photo within the photo is the only thing hanging on the bare
white walls. The women all seem engaged in a humorous conversation, as almost all of
them are facing centrally. Almost as if the shot could have been planned.
","Nursery at Shanghai textile mill, women conversing while holding their children in their
lap and strollers, waiting in line for care.","My image came from collection 210, box 51, and was labeled “Education in China”. The
collection only consisted of a teacher's manual and an additional collection of related photos to
China and its education system. The manual also included two suggested sources from Edgar
Snow and Martin Singer. Their works were related to the Chinese communist movement and
how it impacted the social and economic lives of the citizens. One of the points that Snow
focuses on is the politicalization of education in China. The students and educators were
expected to work in factories and in the fields as part of tying education to labor. Singer
concluded on the cultural revolution happening at the time, where young Chinese school
graduates traveled to the countryside to be re-educated by the poor. The point of this was to
reduce unemployment and improve the education system built on elitism. The discussion
around its impact after Mao Zedong’s death and its eventual removal sparks debate on what it
achieved. The manual also talks about the structure of education in China reducing the amount
of exams they used and again had that emphasis on the labor connection to education. Mao
and his communist regime is related to the whole theme around the images shared in the
collection. The photo I had was #28: Nursery at Shanghai textile mill. The manual goes on to
talk about how politics permeated Chinese education, and the saying by Mao, “Educate the
educators”. This can be seen in some of the other images from the collection. #39: Children at
factory kindergarten playing drop the handkerchief. #40: Truck made at university (looked
military styled). Many of the other photos had this similar theme. Relating these to class, it really
shows how different groups can influence the social and economic aspects of people’s lives. A
leader trying to assimilate the poor and rich classes closer through policy. And also through
avenues such as socially and economically. The clear political emphasis and use of
photography to push this agenda (which could be considered propaganda) to have a collective
nation that is both educated and labor intensive to meet the demands. The countryside being so
different from the urban centers was what Mao was trying to change. It is interesting to have
something like this in the archives in Boston but is great to reflect on when looking through this
lens. Class is something that is very closely linked to education and economics, all within a
social bubble. The idea that each reflects upon itself and that the influence of art is prevalent in
other nations outside of the US is a sign of shared culture and distinct differences that all
contribute to the media we view today.","Discovery Packet: Education in China, undated, Box: 52, Folder: 80. Asian American Resource

Grant Basler,M210_B051_F006_ChinatownHistoricalPhoto_nd_003.jpg,"A black and white image of an Asian woman is sitting at a factory station making fortune cookies
with gloved hands and putting them into egg cartons","This is a black and white photo of a gloved Asian American woman sitting in front of a factory
station folding a fortune cookie. There is an egg carton to her right holding 4 fortune cookies. To
the woman’s left is another worker also making fortune cookies.. They are both sitting in front of
a machine with dough in it and has wrenches and cloth on top of it.",A Chinese American worker shaping fortune cookies in a chinatown factory,"The image from the Chinese Progressive Association (CPA) archive captures the early days of
Boston’s Chinatown, specifically highlighting the labor-intensive process of fortune cookie
making. This photograph offers a glimpse into the lived experiences of Chinese immigrants who
worked in low-wage, racially segregated industries during the mid-20th century. The CPA, an
organization dedicated to advocating for social and economic justice in Boston’s Chinese
American community, preserves such images to document the often-overlooked histories of
immigrant labor. Fortune cookie production, though now a symbol of Chinese American culture,
was emblematic of the racialized and gendered labor that sustained Chinatown’s economy.
Workers, many of them women, toiled in cramped factories for long hours with little pay,
reflecting the broader systemic inequalities faced by Asian immigrants excluded from higher-
paying jobs due to racial discrimination and exclusionary laws like the Chinese Exclusion Act of
1882.
This image connects deeply to our class discussions on how race shapes class and perpetuates
inequality. Chinese immigrants in Boston, like many other racial minorities, were funneled into
exploitative industries deemed ""appropriate"" for their race, reinforcing their position at the
bottom of the economic hierarchy. The racialization of labor—where Chinese workers were
stereotyped as suited for menial, repetitive tasks—justified their low wages and poor working
conditions. Additionally, the photograph underscores the intersection of race and gender, as
women dominated this sector yet faced even greater marginalization. These dynamics mirror
broader patterns we’ve studied, where racial capitalism thrives on the hyper-exploitation of non-
white labor, creating a permanent underclass. The fortune cookie, a commodified cultural
artifact, thus becomes a symbol of both resilience and subjugation, masking the struggles of
those who produced it.
In conclusion, the CPA’s archival image of fortune cookie making is a testament to the racial
and economic forces that shaped Boston’s Chinatown. By examining such visuals, we see how
race dictated class positioning, confining Chinese immigrants to precarious labor while denying
them upward mobility. This photograph challenges us to recognize the hidden labor behind
cultural symbols and to confront the enduring legacies of racial inequality that continue to
structure American society today. The struggles of these workers remind us that progress
demands not just acknowledgment of the past, but active efforts to dismantle the systems that
perpetuate such disparities.

Alexi Lee,M210_B051_F002_AV_Photographs_Chinatown_001.jpg,"An elderly man sits at a cluttered table in his Chinatown apartment, surrounded by old
newspapers, bags, and photographs on the walls. His posture is relaxed, and the room has a lived-in,
intimate quality.","An elderly man sitting at a small, cluttered table in his apartment in New
York's Chinatown on Mott Street. The man is dressed in a patterned shirt, dark glasses, and a suit jacket.
His posture is relaxed, with his left hand resting on his knee and his right hand placed lightly on the table
in front of him. The table is covered with a collection of old newspapers, bags, and various other items. In
the background, the walls of the room are adorned with a few framed photographs, calendars, and papers,
some of which appear faded or worn.
A small clock hangs on the wall to the left, and a portion of a window can be seen to the right, allowing
some natural light to spill into the room. The light highlights the texture of the walls and the wooden floor
beneath the man. To the left of the man, a door is slightly open, revealing a hint of an additional room or
space just beyond. The furniture in the room consists of a worn wooden chair with a plain seat, positioned
beside the table, and a small stool nearby. The room itself appears aged, with signs of wear visible on both
the walls and the furniture.
The cluttered surface of the table and the room's worn elements suggest a space that has been lived in for
many years, while the calm demeanor of the elderly man adds a sense of quiet to the otherwise busy
surroundings.","A Chinese-Cuban refugee in his Mott Street apartment in New York's Chinatown,
photographed by Corky Lee in 1981. His life reflects the complex layers of immigration history, from the
Exclusion Act to post-Castro migration.","My photograph was found in the archive labeled the Asian American Resource Workshop
(AARW), which has long focused on advocating for the Asian American community and highlighting
cultural narratives often marginalized in mainstream discourse. Though the AARW is based in Greater
Boston, I found that my New York-based photograph found connection to their values, capturing the daily
life of a person within the Chinatown community in New York, a community that has historically been a
focal point for both the challenges and resilience of Asian Americans.
To delve deeper into the context of my photograph, I used the written text on the back “Chinese-Cuban
Refugee” and a rough time period based on the other photographs in the archive to search up similar
photographs. Through this search, I found a website titled “Corky Lee’s Chinatown”, which provided
context to support the text I had written for my photograph. I learned some background information that
the man, who was Corky’s mother's cousin, was prevented from entering the United States due to the
Exclusion Act. As a result, he moved to Cuba as a young man. In the late 1970s, he immigrated to the
United States and later brought his wife from Hong Kong (Lee, 2024). This context was particularly
helpful in creating the image caption as I had gained information such as the location, the photographer,
and the year. I then went on to explore Corky Lee and his work, where I discovered other photographs
featuring Dean Wong and his mother (Lee, 1981) and Jung Ping Hung, Corky Lee’s mother, (Lee, 1981). I
learned that Corky Lee’s work often explored the lives of Chinese-Americans in New York, focusing on
both the individual and collective narratives that have shaped the neighborhood and its history.
This research shaped my interpretation of the photograph, which in turn affected how I wrote my alt-text.
I approached the alt-text in a new light, where I was able to incorporate terms such as “relaxed” and
“intimate” to convey layers of history, identity, and memory that immigrants carry with them, and the way
these stories are preserved through personal objects and spaces. This information also guided my image
description as it allowed my eyes to find more importance in the surroundings of the elderly man. I found
value in expanding on the “old newspapers”, “few framed photographs”, and “calendars” as I thought the
viewer could really find value in what they could mean in relation to the elderly man and his complex
story.
I found that this image connected to themes that we have discussed in class, especially with the key factor
of the Exclusion Act, which highlights racial discrimination in immigration policies. The man’s long
journey—from being barred entry to the US to living in Cuba and eventually immigrating in the late
1970s—shows how institutionalized racial barriers affect the lives of individuals and communities. His
story, though not often heard, reflects a broader history of injustice faced by Asian American immigrants.
There is also the key feature of media and documentation by Corky Lee, which allows to make these
personal stories heard and humanizes the immigrant experience. The man’s calm and almost satisfied
demeanor shows his sense of accomplishment and relays a message of overcoming tribulations regarding
his race.","Lee. Corky ""Corky Lee’s Chinatown,"" China Books Review, April 18, 2024.

John Lim,M210_B052_F037_ParcelC_nd_001.jpg,"Three seemingly Asian individuals, two men and a woman, are pictured smiling with
one another as they interact behind tables with signs, papers, and paraphernalia related to the
movement to save Parcel C. Behind the three is a large banner with a slogan in Chinese, with an
English slogan “NO GARAGE IN OAK ST” that is attached to the front of a doorway entrance.","The three people in the image compose the subject of the photograph,
supplemented by the tables in the foreground, as well as the banner with slogans in the
background. The man on the far left, from the top-down, appears to be wearing round, thin rim
glasses with a metallic frame, a windbreaker jacket with a collared shirt underneath, light colored
pants, and sneakers. He has short black hair and appears to be in his mid to late forties. He
crosses his arms and legs, obscuring a majority of the collared shirt, as he sits on a fold-up chair
facing the camera. The man, however, sits facing the others to his left. He is smiling, seemingly
in solidarity and understanding with the other two subjects of the photograph, perhaps implying
laughter as well. The man in the center, from the top-down, is wearing a similar windbreaker
jacket that is slightly darker in color. He also wears a light colored buttoned collar shirt that is
more visible due to his more open arm position, as well as his unzipped jacket. He appears to be
wearing jeans. He possesses a gummy smile, short even length black and gray hair, and appears
to also be in his mid to late forties. His right arm is placed on the right side of his neck. His left
arm is placed under his bent right knee as he crouches down with his left knee near or touching
the asphalt. He is also smiling, facing the camera, but looking off to the right, possibly observing
people on the other side of the table and slogan set up. On the far right, the woman, from the
top-down, appears to be wearing a collared long-sleeve buttoned top, with a cross bag or purse
across from her left shoulder to her right hip. She is wearing various rings on her right hand,
while holding a writing or mark making material reminiscent of a marker, which she appears to
be using to write a slogan onto the paper on the rightmost table in English, evident by the
presence of English writing already present. She also seems to be wearing light, ankle length
pants. She is standing halfway, leaning into the table, her left hand on the slogan paper with her
right hand poised slightly above the paper on the table. She is also smiling, her teeth exposed and
mouth halfway open, her nostrils slightly raised to indicate her likely elation. In the foreground,
there are two tables: one on the left, and one on the right. The left table has stacks of papers,
likely containing information regarding the Parcel C on Oak Street. The right table contains a
large sheet of paper with a slogan in English, likely also about the Parcel C on Oak Street. The
banner in the background is nailed to the entrance of a doorway. The material that composes the
doorway is wood. The writing on the banner is in both Chinese and English, with the English
reading “NO GARAGE ON OAK ST.” With the context of the image established, it is assumed
that the three are participating in community outreach.","Historically, Chinatown has been one of the most densely populated
neighborhoods in Boston. Following a controversial decision between the Boston
Redevelopment Authority(BRA) and New England Medical Center(NEMC) to redevelop Parcel
C into a hospital parking garage, community activists began to bring attention to the plans for
upheaval by protesting, disseminating information, and organizing the local residents to petition
for the preservation of Parcel C.","This image captures a peaceful moment in time, where the small impact of
community outreach is exemplified. It is evident that there is little tension, indicated by the
smiling, almost laughing, of the three subjects engaged in informing passerby about the
impending plans for Parcel C. The photograph slows time down, and encapsulates how people
can in other words be galvanized and collectivized by a shared call to action, resulting in
aspirational moments such as the event captured by the photographer, where individual
temporalities are made representational of a larger moment. This image specifically comes from
the Asian American Resource Workshop records at the Northeastern University Archives and
Special Collections from Folder 37 of Box 52. It was taken in June of 1994, at the height of the
movement to defend Parcel C. This image connects to concepts of visibility as explored during
class. The idea of hypervisibility via the need to be seen and acknowledged is particularly
relevant, as representation lies at the center of contemporary discussions of opportunity and
expression. Photographing underrepresented communities of minorities gives them more of a
voice in order to pursue greater movements and platforms. The act of photographing three
community activists increases their visibility and explicates their presence in a way that brings
attention to the injustice faced by Parcel C and the densely packed community surrounding it.
Documents of minorities in positions of being the subject can be seen as a vulnerable,
compromising state, but such historical precedents can dually serve as an empowering and
energizing motivator for future generations. Indeed, the fight to be visible and advocated is
ever-present. The approach I employed for the image caption was based on my research into the
context of the Oak Street and Parcel C protests, as well as the history of Chinatown. I
approached this with the intention of giving an understanding of the events leading up to the
photograph shown. My alt-text and long image description are derived from the photograph
itself, which I describe in great detail in order to cycle back to the events of Parcel C in Oak
Street. Parcel C represents the ways in which community activism brings people of a community
together under a shared goal. The concept of a community and spaces that correlate to the
residents of a neighborhood represent an existence that transcends the banality of impositions
such as the redevelopment of a community space into a parking garage, which would increase
profit at the consequence of the neighboring communities. The photograph depicts a moment in
time, where the importance of community is illuminated.","1. Asian American Resource Workshop records. M210, Northeastern University Archives

Phoebe Peet,M210_B051_F006_ChinatownHistoricalPhoto_nd_007.jpg,Black and white photo of an Asian American family holding flags in the snow.,"An older man wearing a jacket without a hood, and a bowler hat is holding an American
flag in his right hand and a small child in his left. The small child is also holding an
unidentifiable flag which is at least two-toned, and is wearing a pointier hat. The entirety
of the child’s body is in the frame since the man is holding them and they are wearing a
jacket, pants, and snow boots. A little off to the side of both the older man and a child,
but still standing with them, there is a young girl who Is wearing a hooded jacket that
flares out and looks like a dress. A flag comes into frame just above the girl's head, but
her left hand is out of frame so it is unsure as to whether she is the one holding it or not.
All three people in the photo have snow on their clothing and towards the top of the
image, you can faintly see tiny snowflakes. It looks like the group is standing in front of a
sizable pile of snow, and beyond that there looks to be some sort of structure, maybe a
house.","Possibly an AARW event or Asian Pacific Heritage event.
","There is not a lot of existing context available on the image, only from the folder it came
from. I presume that it is an Asian American Resource Workshop event because the folder only
contained a variety of Asian American Resource Workshop events and more specifically I
thought it could be about Asian Pacific Heritage because the family is holding different types of
flags, which indicates different backgrounds. The folder had said it also included photos of
banquets, annual meetings, era treats, Coffeehouses, and the CreAsian art festival. Based on my
own knowledge and looking at other photos from the folder, this event did not look as though it
could resemble any of those ones.
Because this image looks reminiscent of a parade of some sort, and research leads me to
believe that it is about celebrating heritage, it reminds me of when we speak about privilege. We
have looked at artwork that showcases horrors and atrocities committed against different
minority groups, and we have watched videos about how different minorities are still affected
today. With all of this tragedy, it is easy to overlook good moments in history because they are
constantly overshadowed by everything bad that’s going on, and seeing this image reminded me
of that. People have celebrated their heritage and identities forever, and the fact that there is
struggle that exists and continues to affect people’s lives should not stop us from being joyful
when we can.
Not just the image but also the process of researching the context reminds me of privilege
because with this image specifically there was not a lot of context that was available about it and
I had to deduce that it must have been an event celebrating APH or an event for AARW, and that
only because I had access to the resources that I did. It makes me think of how many photos like
this will never get context and will essentially just be lost in time, and also how many people do
not get this kind of access to this history that is so important. I read old news excerpts that
described what was going on in Chinatown presumably around the time of this photo, and it
makes me realize how privileged and lucky I am to be able to look at this history but people who
were experiencing it, or people whose family experienced it, often are not afforded that same
privilege.","Asian American Resource Workshop Records.

Ty Rothman,M210_B051_F006_ChinatownHistoricalPhoto_nd_001.jpg,"A young asian boy stands in the middle of a protest holding a sign showing a political cartoon of
a policeman brutally attacking someone. Behind him is a diverse crowd of mostly Asian
American protesters in regular attire protesting.","The photo is black and white and is taken at the place of a protest, at the center of the photo is a
young asian boy wearing a light colored blazer holding a sign made from wood and paper. The
sign has a visual of a political cartoon of a police officer, holding a baton, brutally beating an
unarmed man while others around him look shocked. In the background are other protestors of
different ethnicities, mostly of Asian descent, gathered around the boy. Some are looking ahead
while others are in conversation with each other. The crowd is gathered in what appears to be
downtown of a city with tall office buildings in the back. The tone of the image is serious, but also
shows a sense of community rallying together.","This photo was taken at a protest in Chinatown June 1985, where protestors gathered to protest
police brutality against a Chinese immigrant, named Long Guang Huang. They marched from
Boston’s Chinatown to Government Center to protest against police brutality.","This image is from the Northeastern archives, specifically the ‘Chinatown Historical
Photo Collection.’ The photo shows a protest that took place in 1985 that started at Boston's
Chinatown and marched all the way to Government Center. This was a very important event
because it was protesting the unjust and horrific beating of Long Guang Huang. Long Guang
Huang, a Chinese immigrant, was brutally beaten by police and arrested in Boston. He was
struck in the head repeatedly, to the point where his injuries were so severe that he required
hospitalization and medical help. Virgina Lee took control of the case. She was a prominent
Asian American attorney and seeked to fight for justice in the trial. It wasn't just a case of racism
and police brutality but was really just another example of racism that Asian Americans faced,
and there was a petition that demanded they drop the charges, as seen in the Northeastern
archive. The Asian American Lawyers Association of Massachusetts (AALAM) and many others
showed up to fill the courtroom and protested outside, also seen in the Northeastern archives..
They believed that he was treated unfairly by the officer and was a victim of racism and police
brutality. According to the Northeastern archives Long Guang Huang won his case, and was
awarded a settlement of $85,000 by the City of Boston in 1989.
This image directly connects to multiple topics we have studied in class, but I think the
one that stands out the most to me is when we were studying race and discrimination towards
minorities. We spent a decent amount of time focusing on violence and violent acts because of
racism and I think this relates on the largest scale. For example, we saw some art where a
muslim man stood on camera in a livestream and let people decide if they wanted to shoot him
with a paintball gun or not. More often than not we saw people decide to shoot him. This is just
one example of racism and violence, of course in the case of Long Guang Huang it was not a
choice, and it was much more severe. Long Guang Huang was sent to the hospital by a police
officer. It should never come to that, and the fact that it did shows a disgusting act of hate
towards the Asian American community.
This photograph is very important in history because it shows how the Asian American
community was able to rally behind each other and support each other in dark times. When I
look at this photo the first thing I see is the scary poster of a policeman beating on a
defenseless man. Then when your eyes go down you see that it's a child holding the sign and
the image hits on a whole different level. Seeing a young kid have to face the reality of hate is
really sad. He may not even fully understand the situation but his family knew it was important
for him to be there. It's clear from this photograph that this kid stood out in a crowd of protestors.
Long Guang Huang got a settlement of $85,000 but is that really justice? He was wrongfully
beaten and more than likely traumatized for life. When looking at this photo and others from the
file I tried to put myself in their shoes. What would it be like being a protestor during this time,
seeing what's happening around me. That's why this photo is so important. We have to have
each other's backs in these situations. It's a very cruel world with a lot of messed up people, but
one thing we have to make clear is that those people can't have their way.","Northeastern University Archives and Special Collections. Chinese Progressive Association

Alvin Su,M163_B012_F032_PNS_PRA_TuftsExpansion_nd_001.jpg,A black and white photograph of Asian elderly protesting with signs written in chinese characters. A crowd of people in the middle of the street surrounded by buildings including one titled Tai Tung Pharmacy.,"It portrays a black and white image of a protesting crowd holding signs written in english and chinese characters. One prominent sign that is drawn by hand and with passion remains in the spotlight or center of the scene, while another, further away in support, cites “Keep Chinatown Alive”. The crowd consists of elderly individuals dressed in garments that suggest a cold ongoing weather. A vehicle of old fashion is parked on the bottom right corner in between the people and a brick wall building. Just behind a vehicle stands a dying tree, emaciated and reaching above with its skeletal fingers. Now behind all the commotions situate multiple towering infrastructures that include a pharmacy with the name of Tai Tong, connected by a lofty sky bridge above the heads of distant people. ",A protest against Tufts’ expansions for the Asian community civil rights in Chinatown and Boston around 1990. ,"My given image is a black and white photographic capture of a Chinese American protest against Tufts expansion in 1984 and the overall health concerns of Chinatown. From the collection number 163 box number 12 and file 32, the archive provides many community driven situations regarding Chinatown in Boston. The image connects to various themes we’ve explored in this class including social justices, community driven oppressions, racial aggressions, and gentrifications or displacements. Over the years, Vincent Chen’s fatal incidents had a global impact on Asian communities regarding racial injustices. A widespread fear and discontent throughout the United States sparked actions against the occurring prejudice. More specifically, lower income communities, in this case the Chinatown residents, had to fight against a lot of territorial expansions by institutions like Tufts, leading to protests and conflicts. Tufts expansion exemplifies the concept of gentrification taught in class, the displacement of current poor inhabitants caused by wealthy people or organizations. Boston is a pinnacle of said phenomenon as many educational institutions such as Northeastern and Tufts have expanded their campuses profoundly and affected nearby residents. I used various methods and materials to inform my understanding as well as my approach to each piece of writing. For example, I utilizes the online and physical archives for research purposes, which facilitated my background knowledge of this event. The archives offer a lot of related and supportive information on top of my given topic: for instance I can pick up the general tensions of racial communities by looking for significant historical occurrences around the time period. I demonstrated descriptive tactics to compliment my writings, successfully included many details of the image that may otherwise be neglected. By spotting little details, I can further delve deeper into subsequent research of its precise location, in this case, through identifying the stores in the background and scrutinizing the words of the signs of the protesters. Overall, I find this experience very informative and enjoyable. The opportunity to put my hands on many well preserved historical evidence shed lights onto the dark corners and potentially forgotten moments of the creation/progress of Boston as a diverse city. Identifying the relevant concepts learned in class further demonstrated how injustices affect generationally and needed people’s constant awareness and actions.

Starting from the center, we see Flynn with his brow furrowed and a serious expression on his
face speaking into a microphone at the center bottom edge of the photo. Flynn wears a jacket
over a collared shirt with a dark tie. In the upper left corner we see the interviewer’s head. Their
identity is unknown, and their back is turned towards the camera. The location where the photo
was taken is unknown, and the background is pure white, lost due to photocopying artifacts. The
entire photo appears “crunchy” and only in strict blacks and whites, any middle gray tones have
been lost due to being photocopied and reproduced many times.
","Boston mayor, Ray Flynn, vowed to give aid to 600 workers laid off from the Colonial
Meatpacking Company but failed to offer the same support for workers of P&L Sportswear when
their factory closed in December, 1985. Photographer unknown.","My research was confined to folder 41 of the Chinese Progressive Association archive,
focusing on the story of the P&L Sportswear workers, from right when their factory closed in
December of 1985, to when they won job retraining in September of 1986. During the research
for this project, I learned a lot about how the garment workers in Chinatown and the larger
Boston community came together to fight for the laid off women. It was reassuring in a way
when I learned that students from Harvard went to Chinatown to provide translation help to the
workers, since many of them didn’t speak any English and the state tried to use this against
them. There was a lot of this kind of negligence from the parties involved, for example, the P&L
Sportswear company didn’t report that they would be closing the factory to the Department of
Employment Security, which impacted how quickly the state was able to provide help to the
garment workers. Ultimately, after months of effort, the workers won ESL and job training, job
placement, and healthcare and employment benefits while they remained without jobs.
This image was a little difficult to research, since most of the resources I found described
the P&L Sportswear workers, but not Flynn’s relationship to them, and besides the first
paragraph of the article the image is attached to, nothing covered any interview with him (or
communication with/from him in general). While the ID and alt-text were fairly straightforward to
write, I was a little stumped for the image caption, and ended up using many of the words from
that first paragraph directly in my writing. I did find myself at a slight loss for words because I
don’t have the original version of the image and much of the detail in the version of the image I
do have was lost. I ended up writing phrases like “photographer unknown,” “location unknown,”
and “interviewer unknown” multiple times.
While I don’t think that my image connects that much to the concepts from class, maybe
vaguely media due to it appearing to be a televised interview, I feel that the story behind my
image connects strongly to our race and gender unit, and concepts of intersectionality and
disability that we explored. I think the women’s identities as garment workers and chinese
played a role in the long wait and hard fight they endured to receive aid from the state, and I
think that their lack of english skills could be viewed as a disability to their advocating efforts.
Ultimately, I learned a lot about writing about images and researching images with this
project, and I also learned that NU has a big archive of well catalogued articles and images. I
enjoyed this project, and I am excited to possibly see my writing in the website/zine it’s used in!","""Through Struggle and Strength"" (1"" Reel) (English), 198?, Box: 10. Chinese Progressive

This specific protest was centered around the Long Guang Huang case in which an Asian American man was wrongfully attacked by an out of uniform police officer.,"This photo is from the Northeastern archives in the ‘Chinatown Historical Photo Collection’. The photo was taken in Boston’s Government Center in 1985. Honestly, this project was definitely something I’ve never done before. It was a pleasant change of pace from the rest of the class as we’ve mostly been doing concept maps. It was a slow start for me, since I took an ill timed wellness day, but as soon as I got the hang of it, I hit the ground running. As I was doing my research, I found out some history that was completely new to me about the boston area. I never knew that the Long Guang Huang case happened, let alone in a city that is practically in my backyard. Even when researching the case that pertained to my image, I learned about not just the case, but also Chinatown and the history it holds and struggles it’s faced. I found it funny that after so many years of learning about American history and places like Boston, there is still so much more to learn. When working on my image, I used a lot of my time just studying the image itself. I found that before I could decipher the image, I needed to know its ins and outs. The more I stared the more I noticed a lot of subtle nuances, like showing a scared child to invoke a feeling of pathos and sympathy in the viewer of the image. This tactic is also used in a lot of other forms of media as children are an easy way to make viewers experience strong emotions. For example, the news often will display children in need to make viewers more likely to take action. Another nuance was in the graphic itself. I found an image in the archives, Image AO28576, that had the same graphic in the image except in color. The image in color is even more powerful as it has a lot of deep reds to represent the anger of the cop and the blood. It also showed the police in normal clothing rather than in a police uniform, which holds true to the case. This picture was taken at a protest, like I explained earlier, in which they were fighting against a specific police brutality case that stemmed from Asian American hate. A man by the name of Long Guang Huang was brutally attacked on May 1st, 1985 by a police detective who was out of uniform because the detective had suspicions he was a married man trying to hire a prostitute. An initiative quickly caught on entitled ‘Justice for Huang’, hence the protest, but despite this, it wasn't until 1989 that Huang received a settlement of $85,000 from the city of Boston. The political cartoon on the sign the girl is holding is a common symbol of protest surrounding the Long Guang Huang case. I found as I was writing the image caption, alt text, and image description, that I was using a lot of the same methods with different techniques and nuances. For the alt text, I used a more poetic voice for my writing and for my image description and caption I mostly used the visual and historical information I gathered to help form my paragraph or sentences. I believe this case and this picture relate heavily to class. It addresses topics we have directly gone over in class, like racism, corruption, police brutality, and speaking out. The people in this photo all wanted to speak out and show their stance in supporting Huang in his battles with the case, so they held a protest, created signs, and spoke out against the injustice they saw, and it made a difference; exactly what we are learning in class. I think this project is a good wrap up to end the course. It makes us apply our knowledge we’ve learned throughout the course to real world examples and allows us to really visualize how deep these issues can run.s/d/1A_vkKBbfSZxuENF8z-jpIM-bmehsWxPKMUXbFXVRGE8/edit?gid=0#gid=0","Photographs, 1908-2008, bulk: 1979-2008.

John Auguste,M210_B052_F037_ParcelC_nd_001.jpg,"Three Asian American organizers converse and laugh at a street-side information table beneath a
protest banner that reads “No Garage on Oak St.”","Visual Description
In this black-and-white digital image, two men and one woman are seen sitting on folding chairs
before a large cloth banner. The banner features Chinese characters alongside the English slogan
“No Garage on Oak St.” The group is flanked by tables piled with pamphlets, and the storefront
behind them suggests a typical urban street scene in Boston’s Chinatown. The image, digitized with a subtle purple tint typical of the conservation process, presents a
lively scene on a city sidewalk. Two men and one woman of Asian American descent are
captured in casual, candid poses. A man wearing glasses and a zip-up windbreaker sits on a
folding chair, his arms crossed in a confident yet relaxed manner, while a second man—dressed
in a collared shirt and jacket—crouches on a low stool, smiling as he engages with a companion.
The woman, leaning forward in animated conversation, is partially visible, suggesting movement
within the moment captured. Behind them hangs a large cloth banner with both Chinese
characters and the statement “No Garage on Oak St.” written in English. The storefront façade
with boarded‐up windows implies the historical context of urban change in Chinatown, while the
tables on either side, laden with leaflets and flyers, serve as tangible evidence of community
mobilization. The photograph’s grain and contrast reflect the early 1990s film stock, and its
conversion into a digital still has preserved the raw immediacy of the original protest.","Community organizers from the Coalition to Protect Parcel C—including volunteers from the
Asian American Resource Workshop (AARW) and the Chinese Progressive Association—pose
at an information table beneath a bilingual protest banner reading “No Garage on Oak St.” during
a 1993 demonstration in Boston’s Chinatown.","This photograph represents a moment of multifaceted resistance by a historically marginalized
community, vividly connecting several of our class themes. The image captures not only a
protest against a proposed parking garage but also a broader struggle against systemic inequities
rooted in race, class, and urban environmental degradation. For many Asian Americans in
Boston’s Chinatown, the battle over Parcel C was about reclaiming space from forces that
routinely marginalized immigrant communities. The protest was emblematic of a larger pattern
of exclusion where race and class intersect with urban planning decisions that disproportionately
affect non‐white, working‐class neighborhoods.
In particular, the bilingual nature of the protest banner underscores an intersectional approach
that addresses both race and language, asserting cultural and political agency in an environment
that has long celebrated whiteness and homogenized urban development priorities. The
organizers—comprising individuals of varying genders—embodied feminist principles by
ensuring that leadership roles were shared and that the voices of both men and women were
recognized. This is a tangible reflection of our discussions on how gender and intersectionality
operate within social movements to challenge dominant power structures. Moreover, this
grassroots mobilization also drew attention to environmental justice concerns. The proposed
parking garage symbolized unchecked urban development that threatened not only the cultural
fabric of Chinatown but also the community’s local environment and quality of urban life. By
resisting this, protestors advocated for a model of urban renewal that honors collective
well-being over corporate or institutional profit.
My approach in developing this reflection combined rigorous archival research and visual
analysis, drawing from the AARW and Chinese Progressive Association records to contextualize
the image historically and socially. Through these records, I connected the dots between local
activism, environmental advocacy, and the broader struggles against racial and economic
marginalization. Ultimately, this image is a narrative of resistance, a call to redefine urban space
in terms that empower communities rather than displace them. It challenges us to rethink whose
voices are valued in urban planning and to consider how principles of intersectionality and
feminism can reshape not just policy, but the very fabric of our shared environments.

Ellie Bacon,M210_B051_F002_AV_Photographs_Chinatown_001.jpg,"An Asian man in a dark suit wearing dark rimmed glasses sits comfortably in a chair, resting his elbow on a table in his apartment and looking at the camera with a hint of a smile. The apartment is well lived in, with pictures on the wall and assorted items inhabiting the shelves and counterspace.","The black and white photograph depicts a small but homely apartment on Mott Street, the informal main street of Chinatown in New York. Light shines in through a window on the far right. A frame hangs on the wall containing a collage of photographs including a large portrait shot of an Asian man. Beside it, a poster peels off the wall and loose wires run down the wall. Below, a shelf clustered with papers, bags, a bowl of fruit, jars, a container of oats, and other items wraps around the wall and across the window. The table at the center of the photo and the adjacent countertop space is similarly clustered with items, though the table is lined with newspaper on top of the table cloth. Under the table is partially obscured storage for pots and pans. A thin wooden chair sits vacant off to the right. To the left of the table a man sits on another chair, behind him there is a gate mechanism separating another space that is obscured by a sheet. The man rests his elbow on the table and sits facing the camera with his other arm resting behind his back. He wears a dark suit with a checkered shirt underneath. His ankles are crossed, his shoes black and polished. He wears thick-framed dark glasses and looks directly at the camera with a hint of a smile. He’s on the older side, and seems slightly amused, conveying some pride as he allows the photo to be taken of him in his apartment. The photo captures varying textures of the space, and looks a bit faded off to the left side. The back side of the photo has “Chinese Cuban refugee” written in the corner in handwritten pen and a red stamp identifying the photographer as Corky Lee.","A Chinese Cuban refugee man who is related to the photographer, Corky Lee, sits in his apartment in Chinatown, New York in 1981. When he was younger, the man immigrated to Cuba after being blocked from entering the United States due to the Exclusion Act and was eventually able to immigrate in the late 1970s.","My image depicts a Chinese man sitting in his apartment on Mott Street in Chinatown, New York in 1981. Taken by Corky Lee, this photo beautifully frames the everyday life of an Asian-American, a major focus of Lee’s photography work. Though the more well-known component of Lee’s work was his focus on documenting the social injustice that Asian-Americans faced, especially in New York. By researching this photo, I was able to uncover another layer to its significance through another photo taken in the same shoot that also included the man’s wife. I discovered that this man had attempted to immigrate to the US but was barred from entry due to the Exclusion Act, and found refuge in Cuba before successfully immigrating to Chinatown along with his wife from Hong Kong. This fact enhances the photo’s environment by proving the significance of the apartment in which this couple resided: their journey was a difficult one fraught with racism and xenophobia. While many photos in the archive that my photo came from document various protests and activism, it can be easy to forget that the foundational form of protest by Asian Americans and other oppressed groups lies in everyday life. By living in this apartment, this Asian American couple asserted their place in an unjustly unwelcoming country. Upon examination of the Exclusion Act and its subsequent reforms, a significant portion of the US’s politicized racial projects dictating immigration restriction traces back to the 19th century. The repeated effort to police immigration seen across the Exclusion Act, the Geary Act, the Contract With America, and more displays the historical construction of race as a social construct to enforce the inferiority of people from various countries. Race effectively justified the oppression of these groups and became systemized through projects including slavery and immigration restriction. Ironically, this significant historical context is not what Lee directly conveys in this photo. When I first examined this photo I experienced the inherent warmth of it, as an Asian American myself I felt that the scene was familiar and that I could see my relatives in the face of this man. Though when I began to write an image description, I felt compelled to start with describing the apartment in great detail before even mentioning the man who inhabited it. There was something about the photo that made me want to paint out the space first, because it wasn’t just about the man but about his existence within this space. Looking back, it’s hard to believe that I felt that way without knowing any context of the photo. That is the beauty in it, the context does not need to be well known for Lee’s purpose to emanate from the image and carry a unique, timeless, and historical significance that deserves to be preserved in this world.","Genzlinger, Neil. 2021. “Corky Lee, Who Photographed Asian-American Life, Dies at 73.” The New York Times, January 29, 2021. https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/nyregion/corky-lee-dead-coronavirus.html.

Gili Cohen,M210_B051_F006_ChinatownHistoricalPhoto_nd_009.jpg,"A snowy protest in Boston’s Chinatown shows people marching under a large English &
Chinese bilingual banner that reads “Rally Against Tufts’ Expansion, Fight for Elderly Housing,
Nov 27th Monday 3PM.” The scene includes vintage cars, pedestrians wearing coats and
gazing at rally, and storefronts along Beach Street.
","It is a corner of a busy city street. There is snow on the ground. The top right corner of the
photograph is taken up by a sign that is hanging between the store on the corner and a light
pole. On the light pole, there is a street sign indicating the street we’re looking at is Beach
Street. The sign is turquoise with gold lettering, and it reads in english “Rally Against Tufts’
Expansion, Fight for Elderly Housing”, followed by Chinese text and the date reading “Nov 27th
Monday 3PM”. The street on the left side of the image is filled with cars that look vintage and
deeper into the street we can see tons of people (about 100) wearing coats and holding protest
signs. On the right hand side, below the turquoise sign, we can see about 10 additional people
standing on the sidewalk. Some are walking away, and some seem to be standing and looking
at the rally and discussing it. Along the edges of the image, we can see some storefronts.
","Rally against Tufts expansion on Beach Street in Chinatown, Boston, during a snowy November
day. The Tufts Medical Center was to replace elderly housing in the Chinatown community.","When first encountering my photograph (collection: 210, box number: 051, folder number: 006),
it was clear it was purposely taken to set a scene and bring focus to a protest in Boston’s
Chinatown. But interestingly enough, the only information we get about the protest is through a
big banner and a distant view of the protestors. That lack of context pushed me to want to learn
more, especially after hearing panelist Enzo Nguyen speak during class about the historical and
ongoing struggles of Chinatown.
In the archives, I came across the Chinese Progressive Association records (collection 163),
where I explored the broader history of protest and advocacy. As I looked through materials, I
saw many images of sign-making, rallies, and construction. This suggested that the context of
my photograph wasn’t a one-time event, but part of a larger and ongoing movement within the
community. One photo especially stood out, as it showed the making of the exact same banner
featured in my original image.¹ A few photos later, I found another version of that moment, this
time showing a man and woman working together on the banner, dated sometime in the 1980s.²
As I kept going, I found a third photo that brought me closer to the protest. This time, people
were holding signs that read “Housing for the needy not the greedy” and “We have a right to a
community, save Chinatown.”³ It shifted the focus to the protestors themselves and gave insight
into the message they were trying to share. The signs pointed clearly to gentrification and
displacement, highlighting that the fight was never just about housing, but about class, race, and
belonging. Words like “needy” versus “greedy,” and the idea of a “right to community,” speak to
how the Chinatown community wasn’t being taken seriously in their fight to remain rooted, and
private establishments with large amounts of money backing them up, were given more of a
power and voice, than the immigrant and working class community that was actually residing in
the space.
Later, I came across a 1993 photograph of another protest, this time with a banner reading “No
garage on Oak Street.”⁴ It connected to what Enzo mentioned about the I-93 construction and its
disruption to life. Just years after fighting the expansion of Tufts Medical Center, the community
was again organizing, but this time for land that had previously been promised for a community
center. Finally, I found a 1994 photo with a banner that read “We Won.”⁵ That image marked not
just a victory, but a moment where community action led to real change, emphasizing just how
much power the community gave itself by organizing together to fight for what they deserve.
Throughout this process, I realized my photo was just one frame in a much bigger story. In
writing my image caption, I realized I had the ability to focus less on what was immediately
visible to the eye and more on this moment in a long, collective fight for community, visibility,
and the right to stay, and frame my caption around the event as a whole, not just the visible
details. When working on my alt text, I focused on how I could meet a middle ground, both
sharing the visual details of the image, but also being able to provide the context that gives the
image its meaning. Finally, for my long image description, I completely took out any context, and
focused exactly on what my eyes were seeing, writing the description in the same way I was
perceiving and unveiling all of its details. In this, I focused greatly on the banner, slowly shifting
to the foreground, and only finally noticing the little additional details that set the scene.

Though readers later find out Timmy Pham had to leave his lover for Boston, the interview itself shows Pham’s heartfelt connection to drag and personal love. Both gentlemen are smiling genuinely in the photograph, and, due to the quality of the image, a viewer can assume it was possibly taken by a close friend in either Pham’s or someone else’s home. The floorboards and walls are well loved in this home. The photo is taken in black and white, and due to the flash, is in high contrast. The drawers in the back of the image are strewn open, possibly indicating this was a rushed ceremony. Despite this, the closeness of Pham and his previous lover is undeniable (physically in the photo, and emotionally speaking). ","Timmy Pham dressed in drag for his San Francisco wedding in 1985, his husband is next to him wearing a suit. The photo was likely taken by a friend in Pham’s home. ","The newspaper segment, “Timmy Pham: On Dressing Up” and its included photo “A San Francisco Wedding: 1985” derives from the January 1988 Boston Asian Gay Men and Lesbians (BAGMAL) Newsletter. It is included in the Northeastern University Archives and Special Collections, and is available under the Asian American Resource Workshop records (M210). It is included in the V. Outside Organizations file, as it derives from the key timeline of Asian American Organizations that spanned between 1972-2015. The series of records highlights “Asian and Pacific American-focused groups in the Boston area and throughout the United States… local grassroots organizations, student groups, and national organizations” (Northeastern University Archives and Special Collections, 1987-1988). Along with the interview of Timmy Pham, this issue of  BAGMAL follows key themes of expanding inclusivity of the newspaper to new members, facing racism in the Boston area, and an analysis of racism itself. 
             In 1988, in response to the growing popularity of the organization, BAGMAL was renamed the Alliance of Massachusetts Asian Lesbians and Gay Men (QAPA, p 1), and, interestingly enough, the discussion to actually change the name of the group can be seen in this specific January release. Both BAGMAL and AMALGM were led by Malacca native Siong-Huat Chua, in response to the desire to create a  community for Asian lgbtq+ in the Boston area. Siong-Huat Chua, (or S.H. Chua as he refers to himself in the BAGMAL Newsletter), also wrote the interview article of interest. Today, both newsletters function under the Queer Asian Pacific-Islander Alliance, where they are “still committed to providing a supportive social, political, and educational environment for all queer individuals of Asian and Pacific-Islander heritage in the Boston and New England area. Founded in 1979, QAPA, is the oldest Asian queer organization in the United States” (QAPA, p 1). 
             On the included photo “A San Francisco Wedding: 1985” itself, it is difficult to find information on Timmy Pham, as many BAGMAL contributors functioned under pseudonyms and nicknames, like S.H. Chua. A majority of the interview questions in this article ask Pham about his struggles as a queer Asian man in both Vietnam and America, and the shock in the reporter's writing when Pham admits he has not experienced a lot of homophobia or racism is not unjustified for the reporter. Not only had queer people been facing discrimination in the Boston area for participating in the LGBTQ+ community, but police brutality against Asian Americans in America and Boston itself had been widespread at this time. As noted by a Northeastern University Archives paper clipping from the 1985 Boston Ledger, local Boston resident Mr. Huang was struck by police officer Francis “Mickey” Roache thrice in a frightening and seemingly random attack, the same year as Pham’s marriage in San Francisco (Asian American Resource Workshop records, 1985-1988). Box photographs records as a whole also revealed a variety of marches and protests in and around the Boston area, most notably being a young child protesting police brutality in M210_B051_F006. 
“A San Francisco Wedding: 1985” follows class themes of identity and self expression.Timmy Pham’s exploration of identity with drag is vividly filled with topics of queer theory and gender expression. Pham used drag to find his own place in the United States when he first moved, and proceeded to thrive in the queer scene. Similar to Enzo Nguyẽn’s talk on Boston’s Chinatown today, explicit themes of community interaction and unification to combat racism and gentrification can be seen throughout the BAGMAL newsletter as a whole. Despite worries cited in the paper from “Letter to the Editor” by K.Lin and “A Preliminary Analysis of Racism” from Andrew Li, it can be said without a doubt that the Boston Asian community has always fought with a full heart. Looking back on our unit on Technology and Ecology, BAGMAL represents the community commitment to diversify despite what society thinks, similar to previous class discussions like the current DEI drawbacks. When asked about BAGMAL’s efforts in the Boston area, Pham says, “I think it is great. I think we meet more people we can make the group bigger. It will be good.” (BAGMAL, 1988, p 8).
Materials that assisted me in my overall research for Alt Text in the Archives included class notes and Miro boards. Along with previously created notes and word clouds, I utilized The History Project, QAPA’s modern website, and physically re-visited the Northeastern University Archives.
Perhaps it’s just because I am a huge history and art nerd, but this project was extremely fun for me. Thank you for giving us the task of bringing back to life the stories of these beautiful peoples. It has been an honor and a privilege to research BAGMAL and its evolution to the modern day. QAPA’s website doesn’t seem as active as current Boston alliances, so I recommend any further donation or event exploration to be done with QAPA’s close associative alliance, BAGLY. https://www.bagly.org/","Boston Area Gay Men and Lesbians (BAGMAL), 1987-1988, Box:

or pushing children in strollers. They smile fondly at one another in conversation.","Group of 9 young adults sitting on two brown wooden benches against a white wall with a
doorway separating the two units. They are smiling at each other in conversation while holding
their children. Each child is less than one year old. The camera is positioned left of the two
benches, but tilted towards the right. The photograph is old and dusty with a red-orange tint.
There is a strong vinaigrette from the camera’s age. The first five adults are seated on the bench
closest to the camera, with the first, third and fourth adults each holding a child on their lap with
both hands. The first two adults are dark and blurred from the vinaigrette. The fifth adult, center
image, is lit brightly. They have one hand on a small stroller, resting against the grey floor, with
their child inside. Their body is tilted right, off the edge of the bench. However, their head is
turned to smile back at the other four. One person is standing in the hallway, smiling down,
dividing the two benches while holding a sleeping child. Three adults sit on the second bench,
with the last two looking the opposite direction. Each is holding a child on their lap. The first
adult has their hand on the same type of light grey stroller with a child, smiling at the previous
bench. There is a third, empty, bench in the blurred distance, and a person turning the corner away
from the room. Above the center of the second bench is a poster two heads above the bench’s
back. All adults have short, dark, hair and are wearing multiple, thick, long sleeve layers, slacks,
and flat shoes. They are all about the same height. Some adults are wearing hats and some are
wearing flannels.","Group of parents with their children at a nursery in Shanghai, produced for the educational
photography slide series, Education In China, by Multi-Media Productions Inc.
","My image comes from a series of small slides titled Education In China, produced by
Multi-Media Productions Inc. in 1972. The series is found in the Asian American Resource Workshop
archive at Northeastern University. It is a teaching manual for American students to analyze the
differences between cultures - specifically the contrasting ideas of their respective education systems. The
manual suggests various project ideas and thought provoking questions to think critically about the two
education systems and the government's role in such. Mao Zedong’s ideas on education are an important
influence on these reflections. The slides showcase a variety of images centering the idea of education
after the communist revolution. There are children in school, performing ceremonies, reading, and playing
instruments. The manual also touches on social problems revolving around education, like we discussed
in class. Is our education servant to a social system? Is everyone educated equally? Systemic racism and
class divides cause rifts in our education. Additionally, states have outlawed certain topics like critical
race theory in an attempt to rewrite history. These questions ask to what extent teachers are really “free”
to teach in the United States. Not everyone’s history is mandated by state law, such as the history of
immigrants and POC in America. The manual provided context to the photo’s location and date, while I
tried to break down the image from large to smaller details. I wanted to explain the big picture before
zooming in on specifics. Afterwards, I examined the picture from left to right based on the camera’s
perspective. There is a lot going on in this photo, and a lot of people. When I finished writing about each
person’s gesture, I was unsure whether to add clothing or color details. At first glance, I didn't notice any
specific colors, grain, or texture. I tried to indicate the photos age and texture throughout the description,
but my main priority was everyone's gesture/location.

Jiarui Li,M210_B051_F006_ChinatownHistoricalPhoto_nd_001.jpg,"A young Asian boy in a suite holds a protest sign with a cartoon of police brutality,
surrounded by adults at a protest rally.","This black-and-white photo shows a protest march in 1985 after LongGuang Huang was
violently enforced by the police. In the center of the image is a young Asian boy in the crowd
holding a wooden protest sign about his height in both hands. He is wearing a suit jacket and
looking directly at the camera with an expression somewhere between concentration and
uncertainty.
On the sign in his hand is a cartoon picture showing a tall, angry white police officer with a
revolver in his left hand and a wooden bat in his right. With his right foot, he stomps a beaten
and unconscious Asian man. Surrounded by women screaming in terror at the scene, a fleeing
man, and some small animals. Behind the boy are many people who have come to the protest
march. Behind the boy on the left is an Asian man wearing glasses a shirt and a striped tie. To the
right of the boy are two Asian women who seem to be talking to each other, one is a young
woman carrying a satchel and the other is an older woman. The background appears to be within
the city, surrounded by modernist buildings. The overall mood of the picture is serious.","In June 1985, at a Protest rally held after Longguang Huang's beaten by Detective
Kelly, an Asian boy held a board showing cartoons of police violently beating a man to the
ground.","This photograph is from the Asian American Resource Workshop records collection(M210). In
box 51, folder 6. It shows a young Asian boy in a suit holding a protest sign with a cartoon of
police brutality, surrounded by adults at a protest rally. This photo is set in 1985 when a waiter at
a restaurant named Longguang Huang suffered a beating at the hands of Detective Kelly.
Longguang Huang was injured and unable to work. I got that information from another image in
the folder, it mentioned the case related to a person named Long Guang Huang At first, I found
the other picture in the folder, So around him, I launched an investigation. I found a news article
from September 8, 1985, from the New York Times. It mentioned that Detective Kelly arrested
Longguang Huang for prostitution and resisting arrest, but a Boston judge acquitted him. But Mr.
Kelly claimed that he only punched Longguang Huang one time. But Longguang Huang punched
him 16 times.I also found Longguang Huang’s picture and a picture of a document of the
Chinese Progressive Association asking for drop charges against Long Guang Huan His
supporters are calling for the charges against Longguang Huang to be dropped and for the
officers involved to be suspended. Eventually, in 1989, Longguang Huang received $89,000 in
restitution from the City of Boston. And Detective Kelly was suspended for a year. This case is
related to previous themes about race and class. I think they are connected because there used to
be the Chinese Exclusion Act in the US. Many Asian groups, including the Chinese, have
received varying degrees of discrimination and unfair treatment in the United States. At the same
time, most of them had a low social status, which led to the formation of various bad stereotypes
about Chinese and Asians. And to vilify their image in propaganda. And police violence in law
enforcement is also a common problem, especially when dealing with Asians, and black
minorities. But when I was in high school in Mississippi, I used to experience all kinds of
discrimination. It included a lot of Asian stereotype attacks. I think some of the situations that
happened before are still likely to happen today. As an Immigration Country, the US should be
more inclusive and open. However, the political environment now is not friendly to immigrants
or foreigners. I hope this can be changed in the future.","Primary sources

Gigi Peterson,,"A man in a short-sleeve shirt and trousers walks forward with a sign that reads “Justice
for Mr. Huang,” as protesters march behind him in solidarity. The protesters wear determined
expressions, some holding protest signs in Chinese rather than English.","The protestors walk in close formation along a brick pathway. Just
behind and to the left of the leading man stands a young woman in a white striped dress, with a
few people behind her (faces hidden). To her right is a teenage boy holding a sign with Chinese
lettering. They march with purpose due to their serious expressions and the way in which they
stand within the image. The quality of the image suggests it is older, based on the lack of
coloring and focus.","On Tuesday, June 25, 1985, hundreds of people protest at Boston’s City Hall
Plaza to show their support for Long Kuang Huang, a victim of police brutality. Photograph by
Randy Goodman, political sociologist","The image is part of a sub-series containing materials related to the Civil Rights
Capacity Building Project, which collected data on anti-Asian violence in the Boston area. It
includes several articles about Huang being accused of assaulting Detective Francis Kelly and
soliciting sex for a fee. According to a source via The Boston Herald, Kelly said that Huang
looked like a married man who was caught with a prostitute and was trying to get away. Kelly
claimed Huang hit him sixteen times, but witnesses contradicted this, saying they saw Kelly
strike Huang three times in the face. Huang was later taken to New England Medical Center for
eye injuries. Multiple sources also reveal that Kelly was dressed in plain clothes when trying to
arrest Huang. Was Huang to automatically assume Kelly was a police officer in the first place?
Many of the sources I came across offer very different perspectives, some of them contradicting
each other. For example, one article describes how Kelly punches Huang three times, while
another states that Kelly only threw one punch to subdue Huang, with Huang delivering sixteen
strikes to Kelly. Because of this, I had to make my own inferences by piecing together the
information from these different sources.
The image clearly relates to themes of race, class, and disability, as the arrest of Huang was
racially motivated. This is revealed through a statement Kelly made, that he thought Huang was
a married man caught with a prostitute. This is an assumption made by Kelly, which is a critical
factor that has contributed to many instances of police brutality, such as the murder of George
Floyd, for example. There is a clear abuse of power here, as white police officers feel entitled to
use their authority to harm innocent people, usually without considering the full context of the
Peterson 2
situation. It is important to note that Huang did not speak English, which ties into ideas of
disability. Kelly, a white male, leverages his privilege over Huang, shaped by systemic societal
issues.
In terms of my approach to each piece of writing and describing the details of my image, I
started by looking at my image from the center and worked my way outward. I felt this was the
best approach, given that the man in the center of the image was clearly the most important
figure. I used him as the reference point when describing other key aspects of the image. When
writing the context for the given image, I used several sources to come up with my key ideas,
including three articles on The Boston Globe: “200 march to City Hall Plaza to protest alleged
brutality against Chinese immigrant,” “Open police hearing starts today on Hub beating
allegation,” and “Hub policeman says he was punched first.” I also used an article found on The
Boston Herald: “Officer: ‘I was struck 16 times,’ Chinatown brutality hearings begin.”
In conclusion, the image and its context highlight themes of race, class, disability, and most
importantly, a power imbalance that forms as a result of these issues. I was also able to
understand how false information further reinforces these systemic issues, especially in the world
we live in today.

and is leaning forward with a scrunched face. The one on the left has their arms crossed and has
their mouth slightly ajar with a frown. In the background there are more people who are sitting
and also have signs with them in Chinese. Many have frowns or blank expressions and are very

published on April 3, 1986. It is about a meeting in Chinatown for a recently shutdown garment
factory with an image of people sitting down for this meeting taken by John Tlumacki.","My image came from the Asian American Resource Workshop records (AARW). It
shows a meeting of Chinese workers in Chinatown who lost their jobs because of the shutdown
of the P&L Sportswear Garment Factory in East Boston led by representatives from the
Department of Employment Security (DES) William Murphy, Tor Boswell, and activist Vivian
Lee. The people are demanding for the state to follow through on their promise to retrain the
people who were left jobless because of this shutdown that they left unserved for 4 months,
which is a problem since many don’t have an education above highschool level, many are the
primary provider of their household, and their health insurances are going to run out in the next
two months (AARW 1986)1.
In another article on this same issue it was noted that the Garment Workers who came to
this event were primarily Asian women, and said how the DES did not feel like they needed to
act because of how disenfranchised these women were (AARW 1986)2. This really speaks to our
units on Race/Class and Gender/Disability and the concept of intersectionality as the system did
not act not only because of the fact that they were women, but also the fact that they were asian.
It was found that “Asian women who head households have a much greater chance of becoming
poor than Asian men, or white women in the same position (AARW 1985).” The article also
stated how these women had little to no knowledge of how to speak English, and that if they
were given even just ESL lessons as compensation their chance at employability would increase
greatly.2
Finally the article said that this unionized effort did make the DES look into the issue and
a week after the meeting of the Garment Workers the DES planned a meeting to discuss the
extension of their healthcare and a response to their demands in the meeting (AARW 1986)2.
And in the end, it seems the Garment Workers got what they needed as there was one final image
of a card that had a drawing of people holding up signs saying the P&L Garment Workers won
(AARW 1986)3. Showing how this was a huge win for the rights of women, minorities, and Non-
English Speakers. Especially since it seems this event might have also helped the workers of the
COLONIAL Meatpacking Company in Dorchester as it said in the article that the city would go
as far as to purchase the factory, so the workers could still have their jobs.

“Keep Chinatown Alive,” while a prominent sign in Chinese is held by a man in a trench coat
and hat. The protest takes place in front of a building labeled ""TAI TUNG PHARMACY,""
surrounded by apartment buildings.","Black and white photo in a city street. Immediate center foreground features a middle aged asian
man wearing a fedora, trenchcoat, and gloves, holding a large poster with handwritten Chinese
characters. To the right of the man in the front and cetner, a parked Sudan is partly obscured by
this poster. To his left, a crowd of people fill the street with various signs of protest. Off towards
the left edge in the middle, a woman’s face is partially obscured by another poster she is holding
with the words “Keep Chinatown alive,” written in English. Cutout slightly by the hat worn by
the man in the front center, a pharmacy storefront label is attached to one of the buildings. There
is no view of the sky, obstructed by windowed buildings in the back. Off to the right of the
parked car, a row of bushes lines the bottom of a dark building. The clothes, hats, and gloves the
people are wearing suggests a colder weather atmosphere. The image contrast is split through the
middle, divided by the protesters on the bottom half, and lighter, brighter buildings on the upper
half. On the backside of the image, it reads in small handwritten pen print, “Chinatown residents
demonstrate to sign the Tufts or NEMC nutrition center.”
A modern concrete and glass residential building features a pedestrian bridge overhead in the
upper left. To the right, a brick apartment building adds to the urban residential backdrop. The
protesters march in front of “TAI TUNG PHARMACY,” the storefront visible on one of the
buildings in the background, situating the protest squarely within Chinatown’s core.
","Community members march in protest against the expansion of Tufts University Medical Center
into Boston's Chinatown, likely during the 1960s or 1970s. Demonstrators carry signs in English
and Chinese, voicing opposition to displacement and advocating for the preservation of their
neighborhood.","Found in the Chinese Progressive Association records (M163) Digital Repository at
Northeastern, the image was taken between 1985 and 1986. Taken on film, the image is now a
digital print that measures 7 x 5.5 inches. Referencing another angle of the protest, including the
same people and protest signs, with another hand written sign stating ""Keep Chinatown Healthy,
Stop Nutrition Center."" These protests were part of a broader resistance against the Tufts New
England Medical Center (Tufts-NEMC).
During this time, Boston’s Chinatown was undergoing rapid urban development, which posed a
threat to long-established immigrant communities. The protests were rooted in concerns over
loss of housing and community spaces, health concerns, and institutional overreach by
Tufts-NEMC.
The protestors were primarily Chinese-American residents of Boston’s Chinatown, including
elderly community members, families, and grassroots organizers. Many of the signs are
bilingual, reflecting the community’s linguistic and cultural identity. These protests illustrate
cross-generational grassroots activism, unified around protecting cultural heritage, affordable
housing, and neighborhood integrity.
Founded in 1977, the Chinese Progressive Association (CPA) was instrumental in organizing
these protests. Their mission advocated for equity, immigrant rights, workers’ rights, and
community preservation. They mobilized residents through community forums, demonstrations,
and bilingual advocacy.
I was unable to find the photographer of this photograph, but it was likely produced for the CPA.
While these protests were part of an ongoing struggle throughout the 1980s, the Parcel C conflict
escalated in the 1990s, drawing wider media attention and scholarly study. The grassroots
campaign ultimately resulted in the halting of the Tufts-NEMC expansion into Parcel C, the
return of Parcel C to community control and a notable victory for Asian-American urban
resistance movements
Handmade signs on cardboard, paper, or poster board are present throughout the image and
protests, with both Chinese and English text.
The image captures a pivotal moment in Chinatown’s urban resistance. These photographs
document the community-led opposition to the Tufts-New England Medical Center’s expansion
into Parcel C. As visual records, they offer a window into the intersection of land use, racial
justice, grassroots organizing, and media representation.
While these images may not distinctly appear to align with what we’ve looked at in
ARTF1001/2, they challenge us to reconsider our assumptions about media, audience, and
access. If media art is defined as “creative work that requires a technological apparatus for
creation or reception,” these archival photographs—created with analog cameras, circulated
among communities, and now digitized for a broader audience—embody a form of low-tech
media activism that predates our current networked age but anticipates its political aspirations.
Their power lies not in aesthetic polish or elite institutional backing, but in their grassroots
origin. As political media objects, they democratize access to cultural production, functioning as
acts of resistance against both the literal displacement of Chinatown residents and the figurative
displacement of marginalized narratives in dominant media and art history.
Seen through the lens of this course, the images underscore how media can intervene in cultural
norms and catalyze social transformation. They lay out the social justice themes explored in our
syllabus, and much like the media art we’ve looked at, these photographs embed politics within
them, using photography, print, or signage not just to document but also to assert a presence.
The protest photographs remind me that not all media art lives in museums or installations. Some
of the most significant contributions to political struggle come from community-generated,
analog forms that circulate not through institutions, but through lived experience. As Vid
Simoniti suggests, art is an experimental form of politics—and here, that experiment unfolded on
the cold Boston streets, through paper signs, elder-led marches, and the grain of black-and-white
film.
These images don’t just depict activism, I think they are activism. They offer a powerful
perspective for expanding our definition of media art to include the creative strategies of
grassroots movements. In doing so, they help us reimagine media not as a product to be
consumed, but as a platform for collective voice.

Yihan Weng,M162_B011_F049_PNS_GarmetWorkers_1985-1988_002.jpg,"A pink hand-drawn flier with Chinese and English text on the top half and a sketch on the
bottom half. The sketch illustrates people standing together, raising a banner and a flag that says
“Garment Workers Victory”.
","The flier consists of two parts, the upper part is text and the lower part is drawing. The
text part is in English and Chinese. In the upper left corner of the picture, the Chinese text is
handwritten in traditional, unsimplified Chinese characters. Parallel to this, the right part is in
English, which is printed by machine. The text reads “Garment Workers Victory Program. To
celebrate winning workers and minority rights. To build a movement for workers strength and
unity”. The drawing part, which is drawn by simple lines, only uses a black pen. In the lower left
corner is a short-haired garment worker sewing a blanket with a flower pattern on a sewing
machine. The center of the lower part of the flier consists of a drawing of a group of people
holding a flag. The group consists of men, women and children, all with smiles on their faces.
The flags are also in English and Chinese, which reads “Garment Workers Victory!”. Unlike the
upper part, the text here is all hand-written. To the right of this group was the procession of the
rally. The people at the front of the procession held a banner that has text in both languages. The
banner reads “Right to Work, Garment Workers Unite!”. At the bottom of their feet is the blanket
being sewn by the short-haired garment worker.
","A hand-drawn flier depicting garment workers in Boston's Chinatown celebrating their
rally victory in 1986.","In 1985, a sportswear company called P&L shut down.This resulted in the loss of nearly
400 employees at the clothing factory, most of whom were immigrants from China and Italy.
“Nearly six months later workers are still without job retaining and placement
programs”(Garment Worker Rally Announcement ca. 1976). Workers noted that they were not
receiving equal attention from the local government to other groups, so they planned protest
marches to fight for their rights. After a summer of negotiations, in 1986 the garment workers
secured retraining programs and the right to implement those programs on the ground (Garment
Workers Support Committee 1986).
The photo labeled Garment Workers, 1985-1988, archived as M162_B011_F049, from
Chinese Progressive Association Records, Northeastern University Archives and Special
Collections is a poster used by the workers to advertise the celebration after the victory march .
The Garment Workers Support Committee was not the only organization that protested; workers
also received help from local residents and other countries’ migrants organizations. In 1988, the
September 19 Garment Workers’ Union representatives from Mexico called a rally to discuss
how to create a more united force for Chinese workers (see Figure 1).

This image is mainly related to the race/class unit. Given its backstory, this protest is
tightly related to immigrant rights. The main people marching are Chinese garment workers,
most of them are women and their native language is not English. They are all working class.
These elements turn this social event into a campaign for marginalized groups to fight for their
legitimate rights. When we are studying the unit of technology/ecology, there is mention about
the issue of resource allocation. The trigger for this protest was the fact that social resources are
not fairly distributed, thus exacerbating social injustice and class divisions.

The first thing I do when I am writing the caption and alt text section is to consider what
should be the differences between them. What aspects of a photo I should focus on and what
words are appropriate for caption and alt text respectively. In the caption section I try to be as
precise as possible in describing the information about the image, while in the alt text section I
realize that I should focus on the visual description rather than the overview. For the long image
description, I think I should be as objective as possible and avoid subjective descriptions. I think
one of the interesting things about writing these sections is that different people will focus on
different things because of their background knowledge and thought patterns. For example, as a
Chinese person I pay more attention to the textual part of the image. And my background
knowledge also allows me to distinguish that the Chinese text in the image is written in
Traditional Chinese rather than Simplified Chinese.
To me, the garment workers' march and writing image description both illustrate the
complexity of identity in our lives. Identity is multi-oriented. The garment workers' identities are
immigrant, female, and working class. They are actively portraying themselves through their
protests, rather than being defined by the outside world. For example, they are defined by the
local government as an “ineffective investment” at first. When I am describing an image, I am
doing an exercise in identity perception, not only my identity, but also the identity of the person
involved in the image. I am practicing how to see the other. Vision is never neutral, and by
describing others from the perspective of our own identity, we are defining their identity in our
own way.5

Bryan Wu,M210_B052_F007_ImmigrantRightsRally_001.jpg,"boy around ten years old stands in the foreground of a street protest, smiling at the camera
while adults behind him hold signs and banners, including one that prominently reads, “U.S.A.
MADE OF IMMIGRANTS.”","This black-and-white archival photo shows a boy, maybe ten years old, standing near the
front right of the frame. He’s turned slightly but faces the camera with a big smile. Just behind him
stands a girl about the same age, and further back is a crowd of mostly adults holding protest signs
and banners. The photo looks like it was taken on a city street—probably in Boston’s Chinatown,
judging by the buildings and setting. The people in the crowd are wearing jackets and sweaters, so
it’s likely a cooler day. The banner that stands out most says “U.S.A. MADE OF IMMIGRANTS,”
which clearly shows what the rally was about. Other signs are harder to read—some are blocked by
people or partly cut off depending on how folks are standing. A few people are looking toward
something or someone off to the side, maybe a speaker, while others seem to be chatting or
adjusting their signs. The scene feels real—coordinated, but also a little scattered, like how actual
protests often are.
Amid the movement and overlapping signs in the background, the boy’s stillness and direct
gaze toward the camera naturally place him at the visual center. Unlike others around him, he holds
no sign. His relaxed posture and calm expression contrast with the surrounding activity, offering a
moment of visual clarity within the scene.","A young boy smiles toward the camera at an immigrant rights rally in Boston's Chinatown
during the mid-1980s.","This photograph, from Box 52, Folder 7 of the M210 archive at Northeastern University,
captures a protest in Boston’s Chinatown during the 1980s. The image shows a child at the front of
a rally—smiling, present, and fully aware of the moment around him. At first, I thought his smile
added weight to the protest. But the more I looked, the more I saw how it brought something else—
something softer, quieter, which balances out the tension.
The rally followed the 1985 closure of P&L Sportswear, which left hundreds of mostly
Chinese immigrant women unemployed. They faced not only financial instability but also language
barriers and a lack of structural support from the government. This connects directly to our class
discussions on race and class, especially how certain groups are systematically left out of
institutional protections. While others received retraining and support, these women were largely
ignored—an example of how class stratification and racialized labor invisibility operate together.
In the unit on gender and disability, we talked about intersectionality—how oppression compounds
across identities. Many of the protestors were women balancing jobs, caregiving, and immigration
challenges. Seeing a child in the photo reminds me how activism isn’t limited to adults. Families
carry these struggles together. That visual presence of a child makes the protest feel less abstract—
more like a moment lived in, not just organized.
Instead of making the protest feel more powerful, the boy’s presence made it feel more
grounded and real. His smile didn’t raise the urgency of the protest—it softened it. It felt like a
moment of life blooming where you wouldn’t expect it. Almost like a flower growing through
concrete by war. That quiet contrast made everything else in the photo stand out more.
This hit me on a personal level. As a Singaporean international student who is ethnically
Chinese, I’ve felt how hard it is to even get a chance at working in the U.S. Mentioning visa
sponsorship shuts down interviews before they begin to take a glaze on the GPA and portfolio
where I efforts were spent. After Trump’s new policies, some of my Chinese international friends
had their visas revoked and couldn’t finish school. I’ve asked myself what the point is of working
so hard if immigration status erases everything else. This photo doesn’t answer that—but it made
me feel less alone. It reminded me that people before me were also fighting to be seen.
It’s just one frame, but somehow it holds layers of identity, memory, and resistance all at
once, and they all stay through times.

Nadia Youseff,M210_B051_F006_ChinatownHistoricalPhoto_nd_011.jpg,"In the middle of a bustling Downtown Boston, a group of Chinese-American men are
enthralled with the outdoor chess matches spanning across a long table on the
sidewalk. Players and spectators alike study the boards intently, focused despite the
city crowd around them.","A candid black-and-white photo of Chinese / Chinese–American men playing Chinese
chess outdoors. There are about a dozen men watching, crowded around a long,
rectangular table with three chess board mats with pieces mid-game. The table extends
from the foreground into the top right of the photo’s frame. The greater crowd of the city
engulfs the image past the end of the table. The Paramount Theater sign is visible in
the distant background, identifiable by the vertical sign letters “PAR” reaching above the
crowd. The chess match closest to the camera depicts two men looking at their chess
board with a book titled ""CHINESE CHESS"", written in all caps on the spine, sitting next
to it. The book reads presumably the same title in Chinese characters on the front
cover. The man facing the camera most–at a three-fourths angle–appears middle-aged,
with hair swooping over his forehead and holding a cigarette between his left-hand
pointer and middle finger. The same hand adorns a watch on his wrist, and the right
hand lightly hovers over his chess pieces that are not on the board sitting by the chess
book. There is a pack of Marlboro cigarettes sitting where his left elbow rests on the
table, on the opposite side of the board from the book. The man he is playing against
appears older in age – with shorter salt and pepper colored hair – and is adjusting his
thick-framed glasses with his right hand. His left arm is resting on the table, hand
tucked towards his body. His left elbow is resting on the edge of the table and the end
of a walking cane rests near it, the arc of the cane coming up from under the table
between the man’s legs. To the left of the book, taking up the foreground of the bottom
left corner, is a plastic take-out bag holding a large stack of newspapers, which is bright
and overexposed to the camera. The next visible chess player, sitting left of the one
facing most towards the camera, sits at about the horizontal halfway mark of the photo.
This man is also lightly holding chess pieces in his right hand, while the left hand rests
by his face, palm under his glasses. The final player on this side of the table looks
down at his chess pieces with elbows resting on each side of the board. His fingers are
splayed out with each fingertip resting on the opposing hand’s fingertips (like a mock
clap) in what could be called a plotting pose. The opponents of these last two men are
hidden behind the older man with thick glasses and cane. Many of the spectators stand
close behind the players with crossed arms, watching intently with focused expressions.
","Chess Game” by Carmen Chan – 1992.
A group of Chinese-American men play three games of chess on a long table outside
on Washington St in Downtown Boston. The city’s crowd bustles by with about a dozen
onlookers spectating the game.
","I approached describing this image almost in the same way I approach painting.
I thought of “big picture” descriptions first to get the general environment of the photo,
and then narrowed in on more specific details. I dedicated more description on
capturing the details of the main subjects in the foreground, since visually that is what
most people would focus on.
It seems as though this photo was taken at an Asian American Resource
Workshop (AARW) community chess event held in Chinatown on Washington Street in
1992. This was concluded because the box this archived photo was retrieved from is a
collection “documenting a variety of AARW events and programs.” I assume that one of
these programs was an organized chess match in the city, although there is a chance
that this was an impromptu occurrence in the street, as there are public chess boards in
parks close to Chinatown. I concluded that this was taken on Washington Street
because of the view of the distinct Paramount Theater sign, which could only be viewed
at that angle somewhere on Washington St.
In Chinatown today, you can find outdoor chess boards in Chinatown Park, which
is at the southern end of the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway. The Chinese specific
type of chess that they are playing in the photo is actually called Xiangqi (sh-ang-chee),
which is indicated by the round game pieces. In Xiangqi, the etiquette is different from
the Western version of chess, as it is seen as much more communal. It is not odd for
spectators to interject with their opinion or objections – it is considered a part of the
game for there to be a discussion among onlookers.
It seems that playing Xiangqi is more than a game, but is an important
community bonding moment. My initial thoughts relate this back to the childcare
initiative that the Unity newspaper group put together, and the ideas that a child of that
program, Maggie Wong, spoke about. I took her message as emphasizing the
importance of community spaces and time with said community for it to grow. That is
why initiatives to watch children and accommodate disabilities are important, because it
lowers the threshold of entry to community spaces and organized events. She spoke
about how even small ways of community organizing are important – a simple storytime
reading with children was community building in her examples. So I think about how
even a chess match out in the middle of the city (somewhere that is easily accessible
and approachable to community members of Chinatown) where Xiangqi’s participatory
nature invites those walking by to become part of the game, is community building in its
rawest form.","Chinatown Historical Photo Collection, undated, Asian American Resource Workshop

Due to the snow-covered, pure white background, the image has high contrast and a strong visual impact. The subjects, an Asian family waving flags, can be immediately located.

When I look at this photo, my gaze first falls on the young girl in the foreground. Her expression is relaxed, and she is wearing what appears to be a leather coat and gloves. Standing beside her are her family members: a younger girl and a well-dressed middle-aged man wearing a hat. Judging by the quality of their clothing, it seems their family is quite well-off.",This image is an Asian family stands out in the snow holding flags in Boston.,"The photo comes from the Asian American Resource Workshop records (M210), file number A028567. The workshop was officially established in 1979 and, as its name suggests, is dedicated to empowering the Asian American community in Boston. In this photo, it is noteworthy that the family includes an adult man, a young girl, and a baby,an intergenerational composition. I believe this photo, along with others in the collection, authentically documents and reflects the lives of Asian Americans. From this single image, one can see that this Asian American family has fully integrated into American culture (as symbolized by the waving American flags) and has embraced their American identity.

When discussing Asian American history, the voices of women and children are often overlooked, yet this photograph gently and firmly grants them visibility. The flags in the children's hands symbolize the societal expectation for them to embrace an American identity from a young age. 

From a class perspective, a family that is able to participate in community-organized events and be documented through photography may represent an Asian American household with access to a certain level of social capital and voice. In contrast, Asian laborer families with limited economic means and little time for civic engagement may be rendered invisible, further highlighting the complex intersections of race, class, and gender in the social structures surrounding this image.

 

Other photos in this collection depict Asian families having meals, Asian Americans dancing, and more—presenting a comprehensive view of Asian American life during that era. Additional records from the same workshop include board meeting minutes, newsletters, calendars, grant applications, and more, forming a well-structured archive of Asian American history and a reliable historical resource.

These images subtly reflect the cultural development of Asian Americans and, as historical evidence, affirm the existence and evolution of Asian American culture. When viewed in conjunction with other documents from the archive, it becomes clear why the expansion of Tufts University into Chinatown triggered protests from Asian Americans. Just like the artwork of one of the guest speakers in our panel discussion (also a form of visual expression like photography), these photos highlight the cultural impact and disruptions caused by modern urban development on localized, community-rooted cultures.","“An Asian Family Enjoys Their Meal. - DRS.” Accessed April 9, 2025. https://repository.library.northeastern.edu/files/neu:m0427h891Links to an external site..

Yuxian Chen,M210_B011_F018_CivilRightsCapacityBuildingProject_GayRights_1986-1988_001_Page_1.jpg,"A man in a suit stands arm in arm with another man wearing a wedding dress. They pose
together for a photo.
","This is a black-and-white photo taken around 1985 in San Francisco. This photo is a little blurry
but we can clearly see two people standing together, posing like a wedding couple. Both of them are
Vietnamese men. They are holding arms and looking at the camera to commemorate their wedding.
The man on the left is taller. He’s wearing a light-colored suit, a white shirt, and a bow tie. His
hair is short and neat. He looks calm and serious. The Bride next to him who holding his arm is his
partner, Timmy Pham. Timmy is wearing a light-colored wedding dress that reaches just below his
knees. He’s also wearing light-colored high heels and holding a small bouquet of flowers. Timmy’s
head reaches about the height of his partner’s nose. Like his partner, he also has short, soft hair that
frames his face.
They are standing in a room with wooden floors. Behind the man in the suit, there’s a small
wooden dresser with three drawers. On top of it are a few decorations. It’s hard to tell what the items
are, but there’s a small photo frame that seems to have a picture of them. Also, behind Timmy,
there’s a potted plant on the floor that stands about Timmy’s waist-high. Even though the photo was
posed, it still feels emotional and full of meaning. The way they stand close to each other show a
sense of care and connection.
Timmy shared this photo in a 1988 ‘BAGMAL Newsletter’ interview. He said it was taken
during a wedding between him and the man beside him. They met at a dinner party in San Francisco.
The man loved Timmy very much that wanted to get married. At first, Timmy did not want to marry
with Asian people since he had a ex-lover in Vietnam. But the man’s love moved Timmy and Timmy
finally agreed. However, the man’s family didn’t support their relationship and forced the man to get
married with woman.
After two years, they divorced. The man married a woman and had a child. It broke Timmy’s
heart so Timmy moved to Boston. After that, he came back to Timmy and said he would leave his
wife if Timmy wanted to be with him again. But Timmy said no even though Timmy still loved him.
Timmy felt that the man was straight and was only interested in the gay lifestyle for fun—not for real
love.
After Timmy moved to Boston, where he joined a group called BAGMAL (Boston Asian Gay
Men and Lesbians). He said he thought the group was great. Timmy came to the United States alone
in 1979. Back in Vietnam, he already knew he was gay, and he also did drag. Coming to America
gave him more freedom to live as himself, and BAGMAL gave him a space to feel safe and be part
of a community. For Timmy, this photo is more than just a memory—it’s a way to show love,
identity, and the fight to be seen as a queer Asian man in America.
",Two gay men wearing wedding outfits stand arm in arm and pose for a wedding photo together.,"This project made me realize that one photo can carry so many things—feelings, history, and
resistance. In class, we talked about how race and gender change how stories are told and
remembered. In my mind, this photo of Timmy Pham is not just about love, it’s about being seen.
Timmy is a gay Vietnamese immigrant who used drag and performance to show who he really was,
even when the world “did not respect” gay people. Sharing the wedding photo was a brave act. Not
only because he shared the photo after his divorce, but also because he dared to be himself: He dared
to put himself at the center of public opinion in a world where gay people were not viewed favorably.
It’s something that connects to what we learned about visual justice: how people fight to be visible in
their own way.
About the writing method, I didn’t plan it in a very academic way. I just wrote down everything
I saw, and everything I felt. I know this kind of writing might sound too spontaneous or unstructured,
and maybe not the best method for everyone. But, for me, this kind of “feeling-first” writing helps
express my real thoughts and emotions the most. It does not mean that I didn’t prepare. Before I
started, I carefully looked at examples of how to write image captions and alt-text, and studied the
structure and tone. I also revise my descriptions several times before it became to the final version.
About this project, at first, I didn’t even realize the photo was a gay couple. I just saw two
people in wedding outfits. But once I read Timmy’s interview, I was really surprised and touched by
the full story behind the photo. Timmy’s life is powerful. He was so brave to be himself, to do drag,
and to marry the man he loved. And when that man asked to come back, Timmy said no, even
though he still loved him. He stayed true to his values. Even after the breakup, Timmy still had
admirers, and he mentioned this in the interview in a very charming way. I was trying to find more
stories about Timmy, but sadly, I couldn’t find any information about him online.
Overall, this was a very meaningful and great project for me. It reminded me that there are many
powerful stories hidden in small places, like an old black-and-white photo.

Claire Hahn,M210_B051_F006_ChinatownHistoricalPhoto_nd_005.jpg,"A black-and-white photograph showing a group of elderly East Asian men seated
in front of a brick building, appearing to observe something out of frame. In the
foreground, younger East Asian men stand wearing traditional Chinese martial
arts uniforms with frog buttons and decorative trim, suggesting they may be
performers in a cultural event or lion dance parade. People are wearing short
sleeves or have rolled up their sleeves, suggesting the season to be summer or
mild weather with significant humidity under the strong light source. One of the
young men holds a cigar and looks contemplative, while another speaks
animatedly. A sign with Chinese characters is partially visible above the brick
wall behind them.
","Although the image is in black and white and lacks color, making it difficult to
determine the skin tones of the individuals, their facial features and black hair
suggest that they are of East Asian descent. Furthermore, the Chinese characters
on the sign in the background and the traditional garments worn by the two young
men in the foreground indicate that most of the people in the photo are likely
Chinese. Judging by the elderly men sitting in a row wearing short-sleeved shirts,
and the young men—presumably performers—who have half-rolled up the sleeves
of their traditional Chinese tops, it can be inferred that the photo was taken in the
summer or in the southern region of China, where the climate is mild and humid
throughout the year. One of the men is standing with a cigar in his hand, gazing
off into the distance as if lost in thought or daydreaming, yet he does not appear
anxious or uneasy. Similarly, the sturdily built man on the left, dressed in the same
outfit and seemingly engaged in conversation with someone, wears a cheerful and
carefree expression. The three individuals standing in the foreground all appear to
be in their twenties or thirties, while the elderly men seated slightly behind them
seem to be mostly in their early forties to late fifties. The building in the
background appears to be constructed of brick and shows signs of aging, as
indicated by its weathered surface. Given the strong overhead lighting casting
shadows downward, it is likely that the photograph was taken during midday or in
the late afternoon under direct sunlight, with no indication of rain. Approximately
ten human figures can be discerned in the image. Based on the attire worn by the
younger individuals—likely traditional performance garments—it is reasonable to
infer that the photograph was taken during a festival, possibly capturing
participants preparing for or engaged in a parade performance.","Bystanders and performers at a parade. The genre of this image is photograph,
and the resource is classified as a still image. It was taken between 1940-1980 in
Chinatown and currently stored in Northeastern University’s archives, under the
name of Chinatown Historical Photo Collection, undated.","The image captures a deeply racialized moment rooted in visibility and cultural performance.
The photograph foregrounds East Asian individuals in Chinatown, offering a rare historical
representation of Chinese-American identity in a public space. In a country where Asian
communities have often been rendered invisible or stereotyped, this photo stands as a quiet
assertion of presence and belonging. The traditional clothing worn by the younger men connects
to a racial and cultural performance, possibly for a lion dance or festival, which not only
showcases heritage but pushes back against assimilationist pressures.
The image exclusively depicts men, both young and elderly, hinting at gender roles within public
community events. The young men—confident and physically expressive—embody traditional
masculine ideals associated with martial prowess, performance, and duty. Meanwhile, the older
men occupy a more passive role, spectators of a legacy they once may have enacted. The absence
of women speaks to historically gendered divisions in cultural labor, public visibility, and ritual
participation, particularly in traditional East Asian communities.
The image gives subtle clues about working-class identity. The plain, functional clothing of the
elderly men contrasts with the ornate, possibly hand-sewn uniforms of the
performers—suggesting a community where cultural pride is maintained despite economic
limitations. The backdrop, composed of aging brick walls and an unadorned environment, speaks
to the material realities of urban immigrant life in mid-20th century America.
The absence of visible modern technology, coupled with the black-and-white aesthetic,
reinforces the photo’s time capsule quality. It reflects an era when public gatherings were
experienced directly rather than mediated through devices. The setting—urban, built, and
modest—shows the adaptive relationship between immigrant communities and their physical
environment, turning modest sidewalks into sites of celebration and cultural resistance. While the
image doesn't explicitly speak to indigeneity or nature, its emphasis on cultural continuity in a
diasporic space shares thematic overlap with Indigenous efforts to preserve tradition against
forces of erasure and colonization. The performers' garments and public gathering evoke a
reclaiming of space for ancestral practices within a new homeland.  I tried to apply the analytical techniques I learned in the first unit of Visual Intelligence, a
course I took last September at the start of my freshman year in Paris. Although the
methods we studied were primarily used for interpreting texts and constructed visual
media, such as advertisements, they also proved useful in analyzing unaltered,
documentary-style photographs. Through consistent practice over the semester, my
observational skills improved significantly, allowing me to notice subtle details that
others might easily overlook. The librarian in the Snell Archive was extremely helpful in
searching for the additional resources I needed to delve deeper into the context of the
image. I examined archived newspaper articles, audio transcripts, advertising flyers, and
numerous photographs in search of clues. While investigating the assigned photograph, I had the feeling of traveling through time
as I explored these valuable historical materials. Engaging with this archival image
pushed me to think beyond surface-level observation and consider the layers of cultural
identity, memory, and representation embedded within a single frame. While at first
glance it appears to simply document a parade or performance, the photograph invites
deeper questions about who gets to be seen, how tradition is preserved in diaspora, and
what everyday resistance might look like in public spaces. The intergenerational
presence—youth standing in performance garb and elders seated behind them—suggests
a quiet transmission of heritage not through overt instruction, but through shared space
and community rituals. What struck me most was the sense of stillness amid motion, as if
the photograph captures a pause not just in time, but in emotion—a reflective breath
taken before action resumes. In that way, this image does more than record a cultural
event; it preserves a rhythm of life and belonging that resists erasure through its quiet,
enduring presence.

in English and Chinese and a hand drawn sketch of workers gathering on the bottom. The
sketch is sectioned into three parts with three separate images, a person sewing, a group of
people holding a sign above their heads, and a group of people all standing behind a sign.","An advertisement with writing along the top half in Chinese on the left and English on the right.
The heading reads “Garment Workers Victory Program.” The subheading has two paragraphs in
all caps “To celebrate winning workers and minority rights,” and “To build a movement for
workers strength and unity.” On the bottom half of the ad there are three sections of imagery,
hand-drawn in a minimalist, cartoon style sketch. On the left is a person using a sewing
machine sewing a garment. The Garment looks to extend across the bottom half of the page. It
has flowers on it. There are also some words written on the garment such as P & L, Davids, and
Beverly Rose, all companies in the Garment industry, along with some other Chinese
characters. In the middle is a group of people ranging in age from young children to older
people. Many have their hands up suggesting a possible celebration. On the faces that you can
see their mouths, they appear to be smiling. Two people at the ends of the group are holding a
large banner above their heads. The banner is in English and Chinese and reads “Garment
Workers Victory.” On the right of the ad is an even larger group of people that extends past the
viewer's point of view. The people in the front of the group are holding a sign at about waist
height that says “Right to work. Garment workers unite.” The faces of these people have
mouths that are turned downwards in a frown. The garment that the person on the left is
sewing extends all the way to the right side of the page so that the gathering of people on the
right appear to be walking on the garment.","Advertisement for an event celebrating the Garment Workers Support Committee’s efforts in
the Chinatown labor struggle to achieve retraining programs for garment workers in
Chinatown, Boston. 1986","This image came from the Chinese Progressive Association records (M163). My image is
M162_B011_F049_PNS_GarmentWorkers _1985-1988_022. When analyzing this image, I first
started by looking at the layout of the image. I see it in two main parts, the top with the text,
and the bottom with the sketches. The bottom has three separate images that I read left to
right. From my observation, I could tell that this is an advertisement about garment workers,
showing a victory. Upon further research, I learned that this image is an advertisement for an
event called “A Celebration of Progress.” In December 1985, P&L Sportswear Co., one of
Boston’s largest garment manufacturing companies, closed. 300 of the stitchers at P&L and
another garment company, Beverly Rose Co. which closed around the same time, were Chinese
women. They made up 80% of the stitchers. In fact, 75% of Chinatown women work in the
garment industry. The garment industry was declining, posing a problem for all the workers laid
off. Three months later, workers discovered they were not receiving the state benefits they
were entitled to under the Mature Industries Act. They also were not receiving Federal
assistance given by the Trade Adjustment Act. Most of the workers could not find new jobs due
to barriers in language and employment skills. The advertisement in this image came about ten
months after the closing of P&L. This event was to celebrate the progress in the Chinatown
labor struggle and to recognize the efforts by the Garment Workers Support Committee. This
committee was made up entirely of Asian Americans who had supported garment workers
since March. They conducted a variety of activities including translations, both verbal and
written, advocacy, with workers and government agencies, tutoring, documentation and
publicity, and monitoring, specifically in job-retraining programs. The values they were fighting
for included the right to jobs, healthcare, livelihood, and input. The event was held at the
Quincy School Cafeteria in Boston on Saturday, November 1, 1986, 4:00-6:00 pm. The event
included a slide show, views from garment workers, speeches, and entertainment. This image
connects to themes we’ve explored in class such as race and class. It shows how these workers
were discriminated against due to language barriers and a lack of employment skills. When
they were laid off, they struggled to find proper job retraining programs. Additionally, these
jobs pay very low wages, and with little to no government assistance, they are in a very low
class, fighting for basic rights such as access to healthcare. In my research, the images I found
helped me visually contextualize the drawings in my assigned image such as the banner, sewing
machine, and protests which also helped with the Alt-Text and Long Image Description. The
documents I found helped inform me about the context of the garment workers including the
Garment Workers Support Committee and the rights that they were fighting for. Finding a
variety of images and documents painted a very informative picture far beyond the contents in
the original image I was assigned. On the surface, it may seem easy to understand, given that
my image even has text, however, upon further analysis, the history goes much deeper, and it
shows how the event being advertised in this image is a celebration of the long hard fight that
these garment workers were in. It was a celebration of the steps they had taken and illustrates
the power of community and speaking up for the rights that every individual deserves.","“Garment factory interior,” Northeastern University Library, Archives and Special Collections

Behind him, a group of elderly demonstrators carrying signs in English and Chinese march together, with visible signs stating phrases like ""KEEP Chinatown ALIVE.""

Many hold signs with English slogans, including one that says “KEEP Chinatown ALIVE” in large letters. Some signs are only partially visible, reading phrases like “STOP” and “Chinatown.” The group marches in an organized between a brick building and a modern apartment complex with a skybridge connecting the two towers. A sign for “TAI TUNG PHARMACY” is visible in the distance above the heads of the marchers, suggesting the protest is taking place in Boston’s Chinatown. Despite the winter clothing, the participants appear focused and energetic, unified in their demonstration.","Elderly Asian American residents march in protest against urban redevelopment threats to Boston’s Chinatown community, circa late 20th century.","While I was researching the photograph I got, I ended up learning way more than I expected going into this assignment. I started with the digital archives, searching keywords like “Chinatown” and “Tufts,” and came across a set of images titled “Demonstration against Tufts-NEMC expansion.” The one I selected was taken sometime around 1985 or 1986 in Boston’s Chinatown. In the photo, elderly community members are marching down a narrow street lined with apartment buildings, holding protest signs in both Chinese and English. It turns out they were protesting the proposed development of Parcel C—a small but important plot of land right in the heart of Chinatown. Tufts Medical Center and the Boston Redevelopment Authority wanted to build a massive parking structure on that land, even though it was already being used as a public space and home to the only public daycare center in the neighborhood.

Through this research, I found out how much pressure Chinatown has faced over the years. Not only it was just this garage plan, but also decades of development pushing in on all sides. Since the 1960s, Boston’s Chinatown has been slowly shrinking, boxed in by highways and medical institutions like Tufts Medical School and New England Medical Center. By the early 1990s, those two institutions already owned almost a third of the land in the neighborhood and still wanted more. Parcel C, a small plot surrounded by residential buildings, schools, and a daycare center, became the next target. Tufts and NEMC wanted to build a giant parking garage there, offering a few community perks like 55 parking spots and some money for a future center but most of the neighborhood saw it for what it was, which is another step in pushing them out. What makes it worse is that Parcel C used to be a residential area before the city demolished the homes decades earlier, promising future development that never came. In the meantime, the community had been using it as a flexible, shared space and the city was trying to take that away too. What’s wild is how quickly and fiercely the community responded. Thousands of people signed petitions, showed up to rallies, and made their voices heard. This wasn’t just about traffic or pollution but it was about protecting what little space they had left in a city that often ignored them.

Doing research for this project made me think about many subjects we touched on in class, especially topics like classism, whiteness, systemic inequality, and intersectionality. I don’t think Parcel C was chosen with the intention of targeting the Chinese community specifically, but it’s hard to ignore the patterns. A plan like this would never even be considered in a wealthy, predominantly white neighborhood like Back Bay or the Financial District. The fact that the city felt comfortable pushing this project onto Chinatown says a lot about whose neighborhoods are seen as expendable and whose aren’t. It’s not just about race alone it’s about power, money, and who gets to decide what a neighborhood is worth. And in this case, the people of Chinatown had to fight just to be included in that conversation.

The meeting is hosted at the Quincy School, and many attendees brought posters to voice their disagreement with the state’s handling of the situation","This image is black and white, capturing several individuals sitting in some sort of stadium-style seating. Most of their lines of sight are oriented to face the right of the image. At the bottom of the image, there are two people sitting.
The individual on the left, at the edge of the image, has short, dark hair. They look older, in the range of 60-70 years old. They wear glasses with dark arms and thick, clear lenses. Through their crossed arms and confused, almost angry facial expression, they can be seen wearing a sweater vest, white, and a lightly colored shirt underneath.
Next to them on the benches they sit on, to their left and the photographs right, is another individual with a far different facial expression. This person looks confused, as does the person before, but less angry. They look tired, as expressed through their fatigued facial expression and their head resting on their hand. They too have short, dark hair. They wear a dark, long-sleeved, striped shirt, with the sleeves rolled up to halfway on their biceps. These two together hoist a sign written in Chinese characters, written in dark lettering on a white poster board.
In between these individuals' heads is another person, sitting a row behind them. They have slightly longer hair, almost shoulder length, that is dark. Their face is neutral, but their lips are downturned in a frown, representing some sort of distaste. While the poster they hold, which is illegible based on the photograph, conceals most of their clothing, it can be derived they are wearing some sort of dark colored jacket over a light colored shirt.
To their left and the images right, and individual sits with their elbows on their knees and their hands clasped together. They have short, dark hair as well. They are wearing a lightly colored shirt with a collar.
Behind these two individuals is the final row that is fully visible in the photograph. Behind the aforementioned individual with longer hair than the other three previously mentioned
individuals is two other people, who sit on their left and right, in the previous row. At the far left of the image, someone sits with short, dark hair, with an almost completely neutral facial expression. The only aspect of note is that they have a slight frown. They wear some sort of blouse, with it being very light, possibly white, on their torso, and a different fabric underneath that covers their lower torso and arms, with a slightly darker color.
Next to them, and behind the individual holding the illegible sign, is someone with shoulder length, dark hair. They have a neutral facial expression. Their body is almost completely concealed by the person sitting in front of them, all that can be said about their clothing is that it is lightly colored.
In the back row, many of the individuals are partially represented in the photograph. At the far top left corner, just the left arm and far left side of the face of someone are shown. The only thing that can be said about them with certainty is that they wear a light colored shirt.
Next to them, at their left and the image perspective’s right, is an individual who looks off to their left. They are looking slightly upwards, towards the right corner of the image. It is difficult to determine if it is their hair or simply the dated quality of the photograph, but it appears they have long hair, past the shoulder. They are wearing a dark jacket, likely black, with a light colored shirt underneath.
This is all that can be seen from the row these two sit on. Behind them, they are more people sitting.
At the absolute top left corner, is someone sitting. They can only be seen from below the jaw. They are wearing a dark jacket, a light colored shirt, and some sort of darkly colored necktie.
To their left, and the image perspective’s right, is another person who is slightly more visible. They can be seen from the nose down. They have the same clothing as the person before: dark jacket, light shirt, dark necktie. This person also holds a posterboard. It is a white poster, with Chinese characters written in dark letters.
Next to them, there is nothing definite to be said about the people sitting there. The photograph captures the lighting as if someone is sitting there, but there isn’t anything definable. All that can be said is that someone holds a white poster board.","Recently laid-off garment workers listen as Massachusetts officials speak on their future employment. The employees were not given warning, and have since denounced the government as not doing enough to rehabilitate the Chinatown residents.","I found this exercise to be incredibly rewarding and educational. Before the actual image itself, I discovered a fascinating side of internet exploration I hadn’t considered before. I am privileged in the sense that I have never had to consider how it would be to use the internet without the vision I was fortunate enough to be born with. I kept finding myself thinking, “Oh
wait! I just assumed that someone with my vision would pick up on that.” It was truly eye-opening!
This image is definitely focused on class as well as race. It concerns laborers who have been laid off, which is one of the most common modern class struggles that exists. Our economic system orbits around wealth, and those who lack it consistently find themselves being disparaged. The people in this image had nothing to do with their workplace being shut down, yet took on a life-threatening burden because of it. This is apparent in their facial expressions, which wane from uneasily neutral to outright upset.
This also has to do with race. These individuals come from a minority neighborhood, and their struggles are exponentiated by the discrimination they face, that being financial and/or social. This is particularized by the setting being the United States, where Asian-Americans have been discriminated against in workplace environments. This includes being subjected to low-pay, dangerous jobs, of which garment work is certainly fitting, as well as the pejoratively-named “bamboo ceiling,” the notion that Asian-Americans are often disenfranchised when it comes to holding managerial positions, as the individuals in this image were physical laborers.
My approach to the caption was simple – that is, using the image itself as well as the context to create a brief yet descriptive image under the presumption that the reader could access the photograph visually to the same or similar degree I could. I took a similar approach to the alt-text, but ensured that my description provided enough detail that visually-impaired readers could receive the same information.
As far as my long-form image description, I utilized our discussions surrounding disability to ensure I was painting as full a picture as possible. This is because these discussions prioritized equal access. I am fortunate enough to be able to access this image with ease, but individuals who do not have the vision I was born with may need accurate and descriptive text-based interpretations to access it. I wanted to ensure that my writing gave as full an explanation as possible to ensure that the proper and right access was provided.
In conclusion, I want to reiterate my appreciation for this exercise. It exposed me to experiences I wouldn’t have considered beforehand due to my privilege. I found it very enjoyable to perceive and explain an image from a different perspective than my own, and also found it highly practical, as my summer job entails interactions with visually-impaired children who also experience learning disabilities. I will make sure to utilize alt-text going forward with them!","P & L Garment Workers, 1986-1989, Box: 11, Folder: 41. Asian American Resource Workshop records, M210.

Volkswagen line the tow zone, boxing in a large group of protesters. In chunky block text, a tattered blue
banner states, “Rally Against Tufts Expansion, Fight for Elderly Housing”. A black and white logo of a
stoic, traditionally dressed, Native American man stares in our direction right behind and to the right of
the strung-up banner.
Onlookers stand on the snowy pavement—hunched, hands in their pockets—watching the
procession to their left. The street is engulfed by a sea of bodies in brightly-colored jackets holding rich
red and purple signs we can’t quite read at this distance, marching well past a large white apartment
building as far as the eye can see. We see nothing but the backs of these rallyers as they face a snowy fog
in the distance or, perhaps, a distance warped by the aging of this photo.
On the opposite side of the street, a yellow-signed Giftland and white-signed Pransky Sewing
Machine Co.1 also look on—their blocky text still visible to us standing a few yards behind the onlookers.
Above the two storefronts, in the same brick-lined building, lay a set of uniform rooms/units with large
windows through which the hat-covered heads of rallyers can be seen.
A cardboard sign hanging out the window of the Volkswagen simply states “Stop Tufts”. A
bag-laden woman on the sidewalk turns her head in its direction.
","In Boston’s Chinatown during the 1980s, a group of protesters and onlookers are out at the intersection
of Beach Street and Harrison Avenue during a snowstorm. A banner, in English and Chinese, hangs at the
intersection, reading “Rally Against Tufts Expansion, Fight for Elderly Housing, Nov. 25th, Monday 3 P.M.”","The image, found in the AARW Chinatown Historical Photo Collection, was taken sometime
between 1981 and 1990 by an unknown photographer (""Rally Against Tufts Expansion, Fight for Elderly
Housing.""). The exact image states circa 1990 whilst other images–different angles of the same
scene–posit 1981 or 1985-86 (Protest banner against Tufts-NEMC expansion; ""Rally Against Tufts
Expansion; Fight for Elderly Housing,""). The context of this image was rather easy to find as it is written
clearly in the image, but I wanted to dig deeper into the importance of the elderly within this
community, as well as what elderly movements/organizations may have contributed towards this.
Through this research, I discovered that the fight was nothing new; in fact, an organization called the
Greater Boston Chinese Golden Age Center (GBCGAC) was founded in 1972 to best serve the Asian
elderly community. There were also efforts made by the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association
(CCBA) to fight for elderly housing–though they were at times stumped by the religious motives of other
organizations as well as regulations by the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA)2. The latter explains
why another image in the same sleeve shows a lady holding a sign saying to “kick their but” – B for BRA,
U for USDA, and T for Tufts. Chinatown’s fight against these organizations and their actions run deep3.
I admittedly really struggled at first to connect the image to themes we’ve explored in class. I
flung ideas at my notebook as if expecting a reply or a rolled eye. Instead, I found a pattern... belonging.
Now, this concept is not one that we explicitly brought up in class, but it undeniably runs its roots
through many of the ones we did. At first, I was thinking about Land and indigeneity–what does it mean
to have a relationship with the land? With those ideas, I started to center them within the context of this
image and instead start to ask, “What does it mean to belong to a land or have land ‘belong’ to you?”.
These rallyers simultaneously belong to the land–Chinatown is where they have made their home for
decades–but also, through protesting actions on it, assume belonging of said land. It is a slippery slope
that, as conversations frequently do, lends itself to discussions of policy (who decides what can be done),
colonialism (who owns the land), and activism (how do we fight back). The use of the word belonging is
also important in that it implies a form of community. Perhaps it is not about these residents belonging
to a land but instead belonging to a community that has made connections with the land. An image next to my own, almost entirely translucent now, gives credence to this idea. Right in its center, it says, “We
have a right to a community. Save Chinatown”4.
Now, when it comes to the more subjective part of the assignment, my approach was simple. I
asked myself, “How can whoever reading this get the same amount of joy out of it as me viewing it?”.
The answer ended up being to take a non-logical approach to the image description. Logically, we
describe things from one direction to another or start with a certain grouping and build out from there.
That is most logical; however, it did not feel most human. Oftentimes, when we view things, we first look
at whatever catches our eye first and then wander from there. Thus, when describing, I jumped from
section to section until I had covered all that felt sufficient to describe. But more than the seemingly
‘chaotic’ nature of the description, I also wanted it to read like a story–letting you put yourself into the
image alongside the other onlookers. This led to decisions such as me tying back in the Volkswagen at
the end of it all; almost as if to say “Oh hey, remember that!”.
I am, undoubtedly, reading way too deep into my descriptions and probably the assignment as a
whole, but there is joy in writing and further joy in writing for others to experience. None of us were
there that day in Chinatown, but we can all pretend we had our boots in the snow, hands in our pockets,
watching on5.

Kaitlyn Sarnoff,M210_B052_F007_ImmigrantRightsRally_001.jpg,"A diverse group of people, of all ages and races, are gathered at an immigrant rights
protest. A handmade sign in the background reads, “U.S.A. Made of Immigrants.”
","Black and white image from an immigrant rights protest. It is a very
large protest that features Americans of all ages. There is a handmade sign in the background
reading “U.S.A. Made of Immigrants” in a bold, sans-serif lettering. In the fireground of the
image to the right there is a young boy. He has short hair and is wearing an oversized coat. He
is smiling at the camera. On the middleground to his left is a young girl with long, straight hair,
bangs, and full cheeks. She wears an oversized coat as well. She is making eye contact with
the camera.
","Black and white image taken at an immigrant rights protest around the 1980s
or 1990s.","This image comes from the Asian American Resource Workshop located within the Snell
Library archives. More specifically, it can be found within box 52 of collection 210. It is located in
folder 7 amongst many other images taken at the same protest. As I explored the other images
within the folder, I noticed that the 3 main subjects of the image I was assigned (the young girl,
young boy, and sign) made several other appearances. The sign made an appearance in the
background of several other pictures. There is even a close up image of the sign, which leads
me to believe this sign held a lot of significance to the protest. Personally, I feel like it made a
very powerful point relating to whiteness and indigeneity. The primarily white men that hold
power within our country are all ultimately immigrants. Native Americans were pushed from their
land and stripped of their rights so these immigrants could create what we know to be the
United States. It feels really powerful to call this out, especially since non-white immigrants get
such unequal treatment.
Additionally, a close up picture featuring the young boy stood out to me. He is holding a
paper with very small text on it, however I could make out that there was an image of the statue
of liberty. I am curious as to the significance of this paper and what it says. The staged nature of
the image leads me to believe that this young boy and/or the paper were significant to this
protest in some form.
I also found several images featuring signs related to the wage gap that
disproportionately affects immigrants. While immigrants remain a minority in the American
workforce, they are still valuable workers. Employers use language barriers or lack of education
to exploit their work. This ties in the concept of class, and how this unjust treatment of immigrant
workers forces them into poverty.
While I was able to use very surface level research to form my image caption and
alt-text, my extended research helped me to form a more in-depth long image description. First
of all, I was able to gather more information on what the subjects looked like using other
images. This helped me to describe them as best I could as I could, and also notice any details I
missed in the original image. I could also be more informed in my description by understanding
the bigger picture as to what was going on at this protest. In conclusion, I feel like looking
through the rest of the folder was really useful in helping me to gather further insight when
describing the image I was assigned.","Northeastern University Archives, Immigrant Rights Rally (F7), Multiple photographs

Yara Sharaf,M210_B052_F037_ParcelC_nd_001.jpg,"On a street-side protest against the parcel C garage project, three Chinatown activists
laugh together.
","The black and white photo shows three asian american individuals in
front of a cloth protest banner with big block, Chinese and English text saying “NO GARAGE ON OAK
ST.” They seem to be on the side of the street in front of a wooden door entrance. The man on the left is
sitting down on a chair behind a plastic foldable white table wearing glasses, has short black hair, a light
windbreaker, and jeans, laughing with his arm crossed, facing his friends to the right. In the center is a
man crouched with his left knee elevated, his left elbow resting on it, and the palm of his hands caressing
his neck. He has short hair and a wide grin while looking at his friend on his right of the photo. He is
wearing a white button-down with a light windbreaker, as well as light-wash jeans. The last man on the
right is slightly cut off in the photo. Wearing a white jacket with a cross-body bag tucked to the left of
him. He is laughing, directed to his friends on the left while holding a pen, while he is making posters.
","Three activists from the Chinese Progressive Association in front of a protest
banner opposing the construction of a medical garage on Oak Street in Boston Chinatown are found
taking a break, laughing from making posters.","This archival photograph was captured during the 1990s community resistance to the
proposed Parcel C garage in Boston's Chinatown. It seems as if the three organisers/volunteers are placed
informally in a makeshift protest booth while they are taking a break, making these posters for protesters,
sitting and smiling in conversation. The large protest banner that takes up almost half the photo bears big
Chinese characters and the English phrase written below it, “NO GARAGE ON OAK ST” These three
men seemed to be dressed casually, which ultimately shows the grassroots of how community-driven the
nature of a local Chinese citizens ' protest is. This photo captures a unique moment in the chaos of a
protest of the human side of sustained activism: warmth, collaboration, and hope. The handwritten signs
on the makeshift foldable tables show the people's efforts to engage passersby and distribute information
about the Parcel C garages proposal.
Based on additional archival photos found alongside it from the archieves, as well as letter
written by local chinese citizens in the 1998 “Report on Parcel C” by the boston redevelopment, to the
government supports and makes clear that the three activist were actively making posters for the
upcoming demonstrations found. This shows the local people's support and involvement in preparing the
tools of protest. The photo evoked the fight to protect the culturally rich area of Chinatown's land from
institutional obstruction by Tufts New England Medical Center, which eventually caused the involvement
and the union of elders, youth, and civic leaders alike. Eventually, it resulted in the formation of the
Coalition to Protect Parcel C for Chinatown, led in part by the Chinese Progressive Association (CPA).
the community members living in these areas of were the Parcel C garage was aspired to be built feared
not only for the displacement, but for the environmental harm from the garage.
This image relates to themes we have explored in class, for example the reading like lston’s
""Power and Place"" and Julie Sze’s environmental justice frameworks, which includes how urban planning
and enviornmental policy affect people of color, in this case, the chinese community. The Parcel C protest
highlights how a resistance to the displacement occurring is a fight to try to maintain cultural identity.
Alongside that slacks discussion on tactical media relates to this photgraph as it creates a visual tool of
resistance.
When approaching this assignment (caption, alt-text and long description) i used a mixture of
lecture material as well as the organised workshop experience that we had in seminar. It reinforces the
idea of analysing a photos emotional tone, not just what the naked eye can see. As well as the lectre on
tactical media influenced the way i apprached the image, which emohasied context and intent behind a
piece of art or photo.
In conclusion, this photograph and the supporting evidence in the archive as well as online
findings relate intensely with the themes of the course. Protests arent only just in the context we find on
the street, but what the community chooses to capture, document and pass on to others alike following, as
well as the people around them. This image hold an extended story of resistance and unbalanced power
across generation.

Jieyu Zhou,M210_B051_F002_AV_Photographs_Chinatown_001.jpg,"An elderly Chinese Cuban man is sitting next to a table in a cluttered apartment. The space is
filled with newspaper, kitchenware, food items, and other miscellaneous items.","The black and white photograph portrays an elderly Chinese Cuban man seated in a cluttered
apartment. He is positioned at the left of the frame, wearing dark colored blazer and trousers.
He smiles as he looks at the camera. To his right, a table covered by newspaper holds various
everyday objects, including a thermos, plastic containers, mugs, and paper bags. Above the
table, a wall mounted rack holds a bowl of fruits, plastic bottles, packaging boxes, and more
paper bags. On the wall, there is a poster of the Chinese God of Wealth alongside a picture
frame filled with Chinese and U.S. political figures. Behind the man, a scissor gate stands
closed. A light colored curtain blocks whatever lies beyond.
","The cousin of Corky Lee’s mother, a Chinese Cuban refugee who was barred from entry to the
U.S by the Chinese Exclusion Act, was photographed in his Mott Street apartment in Chinatown
in New York in 1981. Photograph by Corky Lee.","This image comes from the Asian American Resource Workshop archive and was taken by
Corky Lee, a photographer and activist committed to documenting the Asian American
experience. His work aligns with AARW’s mission to uplift Asian American voices and stories.
The subject of the image was barred from entering the US due to the Chinese Exclusion Act,
which severely restricted Chinese immigration between 1882 and 1943. Therefore, he first
migrated to Cuba, then eventually immigrated to the US in the late 1970s when immigration
restrictions were eased.
This image connects to the theme of race, particularly in how immigration policies were shaped
by racial exclusion. The political figures on the wall also highlight the subject’s bicultural identity
as someone with Chinese ancestry living in the US. This kind of layered identity is something
that many immigrants share. Although not explicit, I also feel the image relates to the theme of
class. The small, cluttered apartment reflects the economic reality of starting over in a new
country, especially as an elderly immigrant with few resources.
The materials from the course modules were helpful in shaping my writing. For the caption, I
included the subject, time, location, and background context. For the alt-text and long
description, I applied what I have learned about accessibility. Before, what I had been writing for
alt-text were actually long descriptions. But now, I understand that alt-text is a short, general
description of what is in the image, while the long description provides more detailed
information. In writing my long description, I started with the main subject, then moved to the
surrounding environment in relation to the subject. I focused on things that I feel were most
important for imaging the image.
Researching this photo was an engaging experience. I explored archives, websites, and even
visited the library. I found many images of people in New York’s Chinatown fighting for tenants'
rights or supporting garment workers. That reminded me of similar efforts in Boston’s
Chinatown. Although these images focused on Chinese Americans, I also saw people from
other racial groups. They spoke up for Chinese Americans, and Chinese Americans spoke up
for them. It is impressive to see how different people in different places are fighting for mutual
goals.
I also felt a personal connection to the image through the cultural details: the plague with a
four-character blessing word, the mirror to ward off spirits, the thermos, and the fruit bowl.
These objects are almost always found in the homes of older generations in Chinese
communities. This image isn’t just a historical document, an encapsulation of shared cultural
memory.
