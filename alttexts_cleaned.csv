M162_B011_F049_PNS_GarmetWorkers_1985-1988_002.jpg,"A black and white portrait of a young girl in a formal looking business blazer looks into the camera, she is on the outskirts of a large gathering of people. She is holding a nearly comically large sign relative to her size with a protest graphic depicted on it; the graphic of a clearly satirized, larger man beating another man in front of a scared group of people.","A small, nicely dressed girl is amongst the chaos of a protest. She is rather small compared to those around her, a tall, formally dressed man on her right and a woman dressed in a light color to her left. In the back of the photo are several people also attending the protest and some large buildings behind them. The picture is in completely black and white emphasizing the shadow and highlights in the image. She is staring right into the camera with a slightly surprised and fearful face as she holds up a large sign, one nearly as big as her. It has a small, hand drawn political cartoon pictured on it. It depicts a large cop attacking a bleeding man in front of three terrified witnesses.","This picture was taken in Boston’s Government Center in 1989 during a protest against Asian American hate and police brutality. This specific protest was centered around the Long Guang Huang case in which an Asian American man was wrongfully attacked by an out of uniform police officer.","This photo is from the Northeastern archives in the ‘Chinatown Historical Photo Collection’. The photo was taken in Boston’s Government Center in 1985. Honestly, this project was definitely something I’ve never done before. It was a pleasant change of pace from the rest of the class as we’ve mostly been doing concept maps. It was a slow start for me, since I took an ill timed wellness day, but as soon as I got the hang of it, I hit the ground running. As I was doing my research, I found out some history that was completely new to me about the boston area. I never knew that the Long Guang Huang case happened, let alone in a city that is practically in my backyard. Even when researching the case that pertained to my image, I learned about not just the case, but also Chinatown and the history it holds and struggles it’s faced. I found it funny that after so many years of learning about American history and places like Boston, there is still so much more to learn. When working on my image, I used a lot of my time just studying the image itself. I found that before I could decipher the image, I needed to know its ins and outs. The more I stared the more I noticed a lot of subtle nuances, like showing a scared child to invoke a feeling of pathos and sympathy in the viewer of the image. This tactic is also used in a lot of other forms of media as children are an easy way to make viewers experience strong emotions. For example, the news often will display children in need to make viewers more likely to take action. Another nuance was in the graphic itself. I found an image in the archives, Image AO28576, that had the same graphic in the image except in color. The image in color is even more powerful as it has a lot of deep reds to represent the anger of the cop and the blood. It also showed the police in normal clothing rather than in a police uniform, which holds true to the case. This picture was taken at a protest, like I explained earlier, in which they were fighting against a specific police brutality case that stemmed from Asian American hate. A man by the name of Long Guang Huang was brutally attacked on May 1st, 1985 by a police detective who was out of uniform because the detective had suspicions he was a married man trying to hire a prostitute. An initiative quickly caught on entitled ‘Justice for Huang’, hence the protest, but despite this, it wasn't until 1989 that Huang received a settlement of $85,000 from the city of Boston. The political cartoon on the sign the girl is holding is a common symbol of protest surrounding the Long Guang Huang case. I found as I was writing the image caption, alt text, and image description, that I was using a lot of the same methods with different techniques and nuances. For the alt text, I used a more poetic voice for my writing and for my image description and caption I mostly used the visual and historical information I gathered to help form my paragraph or sentences. I believe this case and this picture relate heavily to class. It addresses topics we have directly gone over in class, like racism, corruption, police brutality, and speaking out. The people in this photo all wanted to speak out and show their stance in supporting Huang in his battles with the case, so they held a protest, created signs, and spoke out against the injustice they saw, and it made a difference; exactly what we are learning in class. I think this project is a good wrap up to end the course. It makes us apply our knowledge we’ve learned throughout the course to real world examples and allows us to really visualize how deep these issues can run.","Photographs, 1908–2008.
